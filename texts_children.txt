  Me and my friend  hanging out together  We went to the shop a and we got some ice cream  and Oreos  and money   Happy Mothers Day, Mum  I love you  so much  and I miss you   New Zealand is a great  It is a really good place to be  They’re got 100 countries  and I’ve got 100  and found in houses  you get lots of poisonous spiders  if you want to get bitten by one   Rats are amazing  can’t you see?  They are as easy  as 123  See what it is to be  when you love chasing bees  Rats are amazing  can’t you see?  Rats are as easy as 123   A is for aspire,  B is for believe,  C is for confidence,  D is for dream,  E is for enjoy,  F is for family,  G is for greatness,  H is for happy,  I is for inspire,  J is for joy,  K is for kindness,  L is for love,  M is for mystery,  N is for never,  O is for one,  P is for precious,  Q is for question,  R is for rely,  S is for special,  T is for try,  U is for unstoppable,  V is for vacate,  W is for worship  X is for x-ray,  Y is for yolo,  Z is for zone.

I am not too old to play dress up,  I am not too old to have a teddy,  I am not too old to believe in magic,  I am not too old to play fairies,  I am not too old to like unicorns,  I am not too old to chase rainbows,  I am not too old.   Sometimes you get discouraged  because I’m so small  and always leave my fingerprints  on furniture and walls.   Hi, I am a chair.  Sit down and rest.  Compared to the couch,  I am the best!   Beep, Sheep!   Dads are nice (sometimes)  dads are helpful  dads help you if you’re hurt  dads don’t listen  dads are a little bit cheeky  dads don’t let you do anything  dads are silly  dads just chill out  dads just let you eat healthy stuff for ever  (like my dad)  dads sometimes play with you   Sisters are annoying  sisters are bossy  sisters have a lot of attitude  sisters are very naughty  sisters are very hurtful  sisters are very argumentative  sisters are nice in school   Death is not the end  Death can never be the end  Death is a road  Life is a traveler  The soul is the guide   From the solid ice  on a mountain,  I emerge. I go  down the mountain.  The view on the  way is a black and  white picture. I   Friends are forever,  Or they’re not a real friend,  They keep your secrets  Until the end.  You giggle and chat with them,  You feel sad and cry with them,  You trust them,  You rely on them,  You grow old together,  Friends for life!   Once there was a cat  That wandered off one day,  Towards the forest he went,  Not aware of what he would find that day.  Past the trees that climb up high,  Around the marshy swamp,  Trying not to get stuck,  He came to a stop.  He saw a unicorn strolling past.  He ran his paw across,  Across the furry coat of the unicorn.  The unicorn had trust,  The unicorn had trust in the cat,  That came wandering one day,  Wandering that is,  Into the forest one day.  The cat and the unicorn are still friends,  Friends they are to this day.   Hi Mark. This is a site for people to send their poems, not for advertising. Happy to see your poems, and your comments. But mention of your site will have to stop. Sorry…   The cat’s meow is the strum of a guitar,  The dog’s woof is the beat of a drum,  The bird’s song is the tin whistle’s tune,  The pig’s grunt is the toot of the kazoo,  The flute’s melody is a graceful swan,  The shake of the maracas is a rattle snake’s jive.   One day in Fairyland the clock struck 12,  Lunch time that meant,  Ice cream they had!  Their money was dust,  Fairy dust,  That twinkled and shone,  Golden twas the dust,  Precious like gold.   He broke my plate,  He’s the one to blame.  He made me late,  He’s the one to blame.  He snapped my key,  He’s the one to blame.  He hurt me,  He’s the one to blame.   When you are blue that means  you have the ‘flu’  because you look  like you have  it right now.   Everyday at school  my friends play with me  I rrrrreeeeaaalllyyyy kind of get annoyed  when people shout ‘School time!’  It is really annoying  because that means work  Aaaaahhhhhh!   The wolf found a den  that provided shelter  and warmth  for her cubs  Soon  they were going to be born.   Chickens are fun to play with  because you can feed them  and give them a drink   My name is Ciennah  my age is nine  and I’m turning ten  I see my home  it’s time to go  I enjoyed the fun  or maybe not.   Best friend’s are always by your side  They help you when you’re stuck  They can also be nice to you  When you’re new and when you have got no more lunch .   One thing about friends is  They never give up so if one falls  The other one will pick you up  If you get hurt  They will be able to help you get better  so remember to do what I said  Never gave up on friends   Tigers have a loud ROAR  They’re so fierce, they just want more!  They’re proud,  To be LOUD!!!   Clouds floating in the sky  Steam rising very high,  Ice caps floating in the sea  Shower water falls on me!   Tap water down the drain  Clouds of water falls as rain  Collecting water with a pan  Filtered by a soggy sand.   Jealousy is green  It tastes like porridge  Jealousy smells of jungle berries  Jealousy pulls my hair   Hi everyone at your school.  Lots of your poems aren’t arriving. I think it might be  because you add emoticons.  Just send the poems with words.  I’m enjoying all your poems.  Please tell everyone, and share this message.  Thanks  Roger Stevens   I just had a look inside this house  but why does my body always start to walk?  I have a torch but no friend  I should have taken my friend  so then I wouldn’t be worried  I saw a ghost walking past  the doors  Oh why  oh why  did I have a look?  This isn’t such fun  I’m out right now  I guess I won’t go  there again   Why am I looking  at this haunted house?  Is there some blood dripping there?  I see. I should be going but I  want to have a look  but if I do, well then  bye bye to me.  Because I think that  I just started looking   Best friends are forever  Friends are kind to each other  Friends are just like best friends   Orange is darker it’s really true  yellow is light and shades really well  but the orange makes the color of daylight  and yellow makes the color  of the sun  but when it makes daylight  and makes the sun  I guess they are both good for  EVERYONE!!!   Plays are fun  because we get to act out the story  and do costumes  and have high heels.   Roses are red  violets are blue  the sky is blue too  and has a great view  Crayons are red  and shades a great color  and the roses have spikes  to prick your own  partner   Birds can be different colors and sizes.  Some birds can be small and some can be big.  Some can even live in the jungle some can be in Zoos.  Some can even be your pet.   A monster in your room  is not a great place for you  because when it comes  alive it might eat you  and when it does you will be  eaten into pieces  where there is light  you go in  and no more for you   Standing tall  The tree is  Winding around the branches are  Looking spooky  Curled and sharp  Creatures crawling out  Spiders with long legs and beetles with shiny shells  Dark and murky  The sky is ready to rain  A stormy glint  Thunder and lightning blasting down  Making the tree look sad  The tree is still there  Getting soaking wet  Slowly rotting away  With creatures crawling out.   The cow went mooooo   The sun shining down  At 20 degrees  The barbecue is lit  Watching out for the bees  Sun glasses on  Hats too  The birds are singing  Flowers blossoming  All on this Sunday!   A big toy monster   Me and Jacob like being friends   Each bird,  A different call,  Some can be loud,  Some are small,  The rooster crows,  The owl hoots,  The pigeon coos,  The dove too,  The robin chirps,  The crow squarks,  The duck quacks,  And the swallow talks.   Walking in the woods,  The trees are dancing around,  The wind is whirling,  Blowing leaves to the ground.  Each step I take I hear the leaves,  The crunch that they make beneath my feet.  I see birds that fly over my head,  I see rabbits that hop here and there.  I stand in the middle of the woods,  Listening,  Listening to nature’s sound,  Sound of peace.   The bed time monster   The soles of shoes  stabbed the white  sand – as many grains  of them as the population  of China. The soles   Computers are cool.   I woke up one morning with a stomach ache,  All I said was for goodness sake.  Last nights chilli is starting to kick in,  I didn’t think it was spicy! It came in a tin.   I deserve an ipad or phone  I had wanted a loan but my mom said no  There’s bills and dad said How do you  think we keep uncle Dill alive?  My mom got me an ipad but instead  of an electronic she got an eye pad   First cut the wood   India is a country,  They sometimes eat chutney,  They eat it with food,  May have their seafood barbecued   Pakistan is my culture,  My relatives have a black vulture,  We eat and drink everyday,  We sometimes go on holiday   ”Best friends”  the title we chose  but what does it mean to be ”best friends”?  You should see each other everyday  Well that’s not true for me and you  Should silly little fights get in our way  only if that’s how it’s meant to be  Should we give  should we borrow  should we dance and sing like there’s no tomorrow?  Secrets are traded  privacy invaded  hugs and smiles are shared  tears are shed  love is spread  We know that we both care for each other  I smile, you smile  I laugh, you laugh  I cry, you cry  I wish, you wish  If you fall I will always help you up  and if you call I will always answer you  Best friends’ roses never fade  the promise we made  and I know you know if I lose you my heart will fall apart   I used to live high  I am important  People respect lovingly  I am cute  I am fun  Guess who I am   On my birthday I did what I was told   Dragons are the best  Rest for the fun of dragons  All about dragons  Go have fun with dragons  On top of Dragon Hill  No dragon, no fun  So many dragons, so much fun   123 is as easy as can be  ABC is as little as can be  456 is as short as can be  DEF sounds like your death  789 almost up  HIJ sounds like I’m going hiking  Then finally ten  Happy birthday to me.   Lollies are sweet   When we relax  we don’t let go  because if you go with the flow  you will be able to go  because when that happens it  will never stop  whatever you say whatever you do  that flow will somehow never  let go.   forward and back   Forwards and back   I like playing Minecraft   Friends are best friends,   My friends are good.  My friends are brainy.  My friends are fast.  My friends are big.  My friends are unfortunately.  My friends are bad   Paradise   You do the splits   do you know how yum front is ok   The ocean is blue,  blue like the sky,  the sky that is quiet,  no wind in sight,  the ocean has no waves,  just still…  still like the sky,  the sky with no wind.   The wonderful things about D.I.Y.  Whenever I do it my spirit  starts to rise. It’s so much fun when  you do it yourself you can even  build your very own shelf. On that  shelf you can keep all your creations  and doing all these crafts will keep your  mind off tasty temptations. So as soon  as you try to do all kinds of fun D.I.Y.  try to be careful and be very wise.   Fortnite is the best  Fortnite is great  Fortnight with pleasure   best  mates  are  nice  they  care  for  each  other   i am Melissa  I like to play  but not to fight  I like ice cream  but not when you drop it  I like to play hide and seek  no one ever finds me  I tidy my room  I don’t like messy  I have many friends  but not a lot of bullies  I like to sing  but I don’t know if I’m good  I’m 10 and love my life   As the trees blow by, the birds grow more   When it comes to a birthday   If only I could be a bee. He sighed,  then Norman had a quite,  amazing and brilliant  Idea…   My dragon has…  Rainbow scales,  Purple eyes,  Shiny scales,  Go my DRAGON!   You only get one time to shine in the light of the night you can shine if you want to you’re amazing oh yeah so you can shine if you want to shine if you want to yeah want to yes shine if you want to oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah   You’re cool and you know it   Forwards and back   The trees they blow in the breeze  they sway their branches like rattling keys  the bees fly in threes as happy as me  and when it’s time to leave I say thanks to the trees.   Oh so good this day is  Oh so good this food is  Some things are oh so good   There is an owl hooting in the night,  With it’s yellow beak  And wings to help it fly.  Its eyes are yellow, gleaming in the light of the moon,  You can see Its silhouette in the night sky.  I just stand there and watch him fly,  He is swooping above searching for his prey,  With still eyes,  Turning his head to and fro,  Then the owl spots me,  Off he goes…   I didn’t read fast enough  I didn’t walk far enough  I didn’t talk clearly  I didn’t sleep early  I didn’t smile happily  I didn’t clean properly  I didn’t say, “ I didn’t! “  But I did say, “Stop saying that mum!”   What is this?  It is something strange,  I was in fear and started to tear.  What happened?  The butterfly got hurt,  The mouse died,  Where am I?  This is something strange,  But what is it?  What it is?  I think a ghost is here,  No, a man got hurt!  No, I think my cousins are here,  And they really were here,  We found the strange mystery.  Yay! I am very very happy,  We started to tear,  In such happiness,  I cuddled him,  He came to me,  He loves me,  He likes me,  I love him,  He is the best,  He laughed,  He had a big, big tear  And let’s await another mystery!   As sweet as sugar,  Moist yummy mixture inside,  Melting in my mouth.   I am Elsie,  I love to write,  I don’t like to fight,  I love to draw and paint,  I play the flute,  I play the tin whistle,  I hate getting pricked by thistles,  I am home educated,  I love to write poetry,  And put my poems on the Poetry Zone!   As it becomes evening,  I walk on the footpath  That is to the side of  The road. The world   If you don’t like chocolate  You can be my friend,  And I can eat it all instead!   I haven’t got time  To write a rhyme!  I really have to be going.  I’ll say “Goodbye.”  I have to fly!  No time to write a poem!   I grow on trees but I’m not a leaf  I mixed my colours, yellow and red  I am mostly found in an orchard  I provides juice for you  I hides seeds too  I can cure you with my juice  What am I?  I’m…   They are:   Gramps Grig had a pig  In a field of clover.  Piggy died,  Gramps cried,  All the fun was over.   Sometimes then and there we all need a friend.   Roses are red, violets are blue,  He’s for me, not for you…   I can’t wait for tonight  the Superbowl is near  we will laugh and cry, we will even cheer   I love those lovely Friday mornings as I sit and watch TV  My mom butters my toast, I like to watch her face gleam.  Sure I love Fridays but I find Mondays are the best   I’m in the lobby,   Swimming through the water   Sweet smell of pine  Delicious marshmallows  Beautiful stars   Haiku   Red is the sunset on a summer’s day,  Orange is the flames burning on the bonfire,  Yellow is the glow of the sun so bright,  Green is the sweetness of the freshly cut grass,  Blue is the sadness of the emotions,  Indigo is the colours of the ocean,  Violet is the night sky colour.   Hi,  I am carrot,  It rhymes with parrot,  I like to ride in a chariot,  Towed by rats.  I am rotten,  I got thrown away,  I am left outside for birds to peck.   Here comes a boy running down the pitch   My beauty, my Earth  Has given us birth  It has taught us  English, Spanish, Hindi and Portuguese  And it has kept for us peace  It also has thunder, splash, tsunami and storms  And it also has many other soil forms  It’s also a beautiful place  Really!!!  Earth has won my heart’s race !!!   I love my lunch,  Even though I had a bunch.  I love, I love food,  Although my sister’s rude.   if you like to play lots of different sports  then try a new sport  Most people like to do sport  they just like to relax  If you play sport it is good for you because it pumps your heart up  ready for the the different sports you do  DON’T FORGET TO TRY DIFFERENT SPORTS   A hundred trees, as tall as a utility pole,  Stand to the west of my house.  The hot sun shines on them.  They don’t care, they’re covered.   My name is Filbert Fox,  I’m gonna help you be  A master of your 8 times table  Yeah you’re gonna see.   Wolves howl in the night,  See their vicious faces in the moonlight.  Their eyes as red as flames,  Always fighting and playing games.  Hiding to catch their prey,  In caves where they would stay.  Slobber drooling down their faces,  Teeth that are as sharp as maces.   Bruises and bruises, I have bruises  I get them from cats  I get them from dogs  Especially from bats  I even get them from logs.   I love my school  It is the best school I ever go to of my life  With air-conditioner, clean toilet and Google classroom  Being a prefect is the best  My school is always honest, care for each other and mostly fair  That is why i love my school!   I watch many videos on Youtube  An idea came to my mind  I wanted to be a Youtuber  I told my parents and asked for permission  I had my permission  I made a video and posted it  I waited excitedly  The next day I woke up, I saw 5 dislikes  I was sad  Now I know that being a Youtuber is not easy.   People  Some are nice  Some like mice  Some are mean  But everyone has a role in this world  Either it’s writing a word  Or helping others   I  I l  I lo  I lov  I love  I love F  I love Fo  I love For  I love Fort  I love Fortn  I love Fortni  I love Fortnit  I love Fortnite  I love Fortnite,  I love Fortnite, I  I love Fortnite, I d  I love Fortnite, I do  I love Fortnite, I don  I love Fortnite, I don’t  I love Fortnite, I don’t L  I love Fortnite, I don’t Lo  I love Fortnite, I don’t Lov  I love Fortnite, I don’t Love  I love Fortnite, I don’t Love P  I love Fortnite, I don’t Love PU  I love Fortnite, I don’t Love PUB  I love Fortnite, I don’t Love PUBG  I love Fortnite, I don’t Love PUBG.   I see the curtains move in the breeze,  What could it be?  It could be a monster or a spider crawling up,  Or it could be a fairy getting stuck!  It sounds like a storm brewing,  It sounds like wind chimes chiming,  What could it be I ask myself,  Is it really the breeze?   There once was a boy name Harry  He preferred to be called Perry  Then, he fell down a hole and said,  YEET!   I wake up to go to school,  and everything is great  until I look at the time  and I’m late!  I go to get breakfast,  but I don’t know what to eat  then I realize all that’s left is meat!  I say I’m fine so I go do my hair,  when I look in the mirror I look like a bear!  I brush my teeth, get dressed and pack my bag,  I then realize I have a math test and I am ready to gag  I get to school but don’t worry everything is cool! <img alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" src="http://poetryzone.co.uk/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;"/>   I wake up in the morning and don’t want to get out of bed  So I yell to my mother, don’t wake me up out of bed.  Then she runs up the stairs and comes in my room   Bob has a mule.   The rainbow, red and bright.  Too bad it will be gone  Later this night.  All the colors shine so bright.  Red, orange and yellow.  Green, blue and purple.  I wonder what’s on the other side?  Some say gold some say pie.   Wind, air, all the same just   I like to sing and play  On and on all day  We play every day  I like to sing and play  YAY!   I saw the river run  Down by the forest  The rabbit hopped towards it  But I ran from it.  If you see that beast  Down by the river.  Don’t even shake  Don’t even shiver   USA  USA is  USA is a  USA is a great  USA is a great place  USA is a great place to  USA is a great place to live  USA is a great place to live because  USA is a great place to live because it  USA is a great place to live because it is  USA is a great place to live because it is Beautiful   My mom says eat your veggies  Why?  My teacher says do your math  Why?  My dad says go to bed  Why?  My big sister says read a book  Why?  My little brother says play with me  Why?  Your teacher says read this  Why?  The end   I once ate a Hershey Bar  And it gave me a sugar rush  It was only one minute  Until my sugar rush was gone  But in that one minute  I tore the house down with my energy   My mom says go to bed  Why?  My dad says get in the car  Why?  My teacher says work  Why?  My sister says come here  Why?  My brother says do your homework  Why?  I say play on my phone   I wake up in the morning, and don’t want to get out of bed!  so I tell my mom don’t make me!  Then I have to get out of bed,  I jump out of bed just to turn off the alarm clock she set,  But SHE PUT IT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM!  She says that I need to get up, breakfast is getting cold!  I dread getting up and getting dressed.  After I’m dressed I run downstairs to eat my breakfast,  and I find my dad munching on my breakfast!  “HOW DARE YOU,” I say. and he just says “You took too long  and I was getting hungry!”  So I say, “MOMMY, DADDY ATE MY BREAKFAST!”  So I make my own toast, now I hear the BUS!  I leap out of my house and run to the bus  just in time to catch it!   My school is the best, then the rest  Our motto could win the Lotto  The teachers have inspirational features  The learning is fun once it’s done  We take pride in our powerful stride  My school is cool and a jewel  I love my school!   Dad’s birthday is here  And a good one it will be  Dad oh dad  See how happy you can be  Birthday oh birthday, it is here again  I can’t wait for mine  Really I can’t wait  There will be balloons everywhere   they are really cute  they are your best friends forever  I love them so much   My siblings are so so sweet,  and to have them around is such a treat!  I have one brother and three sisters,  so we can only call one of them mister!  They are as perfect as pumpkin pie,  but when my baby brother is fussy, he starts to cry!  Anyway that’s all for now,  but I LOVE my siblings anyhow!   I woke up one morning feeling just fine  I went outside to play and to see the sunshine  When I got outside there was a blue bird on my fence  He was fighting with a duck man, it was intense  The poor blue bird fell off the wall, the duck kept the food  The poor blue bird went straight to rest, the other ducks woooed and woooed  Oh that poor blue bird   GYMNASTICS, GYMNASTICS,  it’s simply the best.  GYMNASTICS, GYMNASTICS,  I could flip over your head.  GYMNASTICS, GYMNASTICS,  I can cartwheel all day.  GYMNASTICS, GYMNASTICS,  just lead the way!!!!!!!!!!   Our love is the deepest ocean  the deepest ocean that never ends  the top is so shiny it looks like crystals  like the glimmering coral waterfall   Outside you can play. You could play all day.  You can play a sport or build a fort.  You can dance and sing or build something.  If it’s wet and rainy you can use an umbrella  and trust me it’s way more fun than sitting inside and  eating mozzarella. I am so very sorry that I have been  rambling on but it’s very hard to stop when you’re  thinking about playing on your big green lawn. Now  back to the topic of being outside, the quantity of  things to do is ever so wide. So when the the day is over  and you go to bed remember to always do what I said.   Dog  Dog on  Dog on bike  Dog on bike riding  Dog on bike riding backwards  Dog on bike riding backwards eating ice cream  Dog on bike riding backwards eating ice cream fell off  Dog on bike riding backwards eating ice cream fell off   Dinner at 10:00  In the Tower of Terror  Saying all the fun restaurants  Nothing but fun  Enjoying family  You are having fun   Gymnastics is fun   When I was five  I was transparent  I wore my heart on my sleeve  I told everyone what I thought  To have them guffaw  And roar in laughter   I dance  I prance  I feel free  I feel me  I move  I groove  I stomp  I move, I romp   Welcome come in  Out your stuff in the bin  Have a good time  Make sure you have fun  Let’s play fun games  Let’s solve a maze   If I had the might,  I would bring Nigeria back into the light.   Over the mystical sandy floor  Colours fill the sea,  Ending never.  Algae covers the place,  New creatures always.   Roses are red   The beasts are crawling  they are everywhere you go  Oh no, Black Widow!   I hear this song sung today,  It sounds not too far away,  I follow the song sung gracefully,  I follow the song sung flowingly,  I follow the song sung harmonised,  I follow the song sung today.   Africa  Africa is  Africa is a  Africa is a huge  Africa is a huge continent  Africa is a huge continent with 55 countries   Once there was a bear called Norman  who loved honey.  He really, really, really loved it  and he was always sad when  it ran out.  But getting hold of more honey was a bit… tricky.   There are seven  Continents  First it’s North and South America  Next, I went to this place and your  Friend said – Europe  After Africa, later every time  I show my Kangaroo named Stralia  They’ll say Australia,  Next Asia  After that Antarctica  It’s only ice   These poems aren’t coming through, Mark.   The loud roar of thunder  Rings in my ears  A jolt of electricity  Comes hurtling down from the sky  I lay shivering under my covers  Scared of the loud noises  Another bang  Slowly, I swing my feet off the bed  And walk towards the window  The clouds are crackling angrily  Electricity sparkling off them  Stormy and dark  But the lightning makes it brighter  Flickering into existence  Only to disappear a second later  I stand, hypnotized  Mesmerized by the sight  All fear forgotten  And from that day  I know  Never to fear thunder storms   She is steel  She walks with her head held high  I watch her run  Her stamina is steel  Her confidence unwavering  Her eyes revealing nothing  They hold my gaze  I don’t look away  Although her steely expression  Along with her icy cold eyes  Are enough to pierce anybody  Enough to have them terrified  But blazing passion burns inside me  I have infinite fuel  For the fire that is set ablaze  Inside my heart  And only my fire can soften the steel  Burn through the icy mask  She looks perplexed  The first emotion she’s shown in years  I hug her  My fire warms her  It melts through the armor of steel  Which she wears around her heart   The reflection of myself in  The water was as smooth as  The reflection in a mirror.   They are the colours in the fields,  They are the scent in the air,  They help put honey in your jar,  They travel so far,  They are always around to brighten you up  Whenever your day is bad,  Flowers are rad!   Hi, I’m Mark  and I’ll teach all about Africa  First Africa is a continent  A continent is a place with countries  Africa has more countries than Europe  Africa has 55 countries  It is super hot there  Let’s dare to name some countries in Africa  Okay, let’s go  Morocco, Niger, Nigeria, Chad and Swaziland   I’m in a band,  when I get a new brand.  I like to sing,  Even though I’ve got a ring.   He runs around with his little legs,  Prancing around in the shards of grass,  His tiny ears flapping around,  His feet can’t keep up,  He face plants the ground!  The sun is shining through the window,  He falls asleep as soon as he can,  Brown and white,  He loves to dig,  He has a speckled nose,  He likes to lick!   Air pollution  Awful, crummy  Killing, dying, executing  Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Greenland, Antarctica  Healing, helping, saving  Acceptable, nice  Fresh air   We need to stop making bad air  Animals and human need to be fair   The pollution is bad  People are sad  People ask  To have a mask  People have to stop the factory  So we will have victory   Hello!  All over there  Be kind  In other place  That place can be a habitat  And also is animals home  Today be kind!!!   I play in the sun on this warm day,  I hear birds that sing,  And smell scents that bring  Happiness all around.  The sun is shining all day long  My mouth gets dry from the heat  I get sun burnt because I never wore sun cream!  I love the sun,  The sound of the bees buzzing around,  The sound of the bird’s song  Brings happiness all around.  The Sun.   Why work when you can play?  Why work when it’s a sunny day?  Why work when you can watch TV?  Why work when you can play with me?   I sit in the seat of the roller coaster,  Waiting for it to move.  Slowly it sets of,  Then zooming up the slope,  Whoosh we go down the steep bump,  Around the corner flinging us about,  The force scraping through our hair on the warm spring day,  Then a sudden break makes me jump,  Off we go again,  Sitting in the seat of the roller coaster,  Nothing is in our way!   5,4,3,2…  The room goes black,  Faster and faster I go round,  Sitting next to my friend,  Flashes and colours fill the place,  Over waves, faster…  Flicker… Flicker…  I can hear screams,  I can hear laughter,  Faster…  Faster we go round and round,  Pitch black…  Can’t see…  The force pushes my face back,  Faster… faster  What a thriller ride!   When you left  You left a gaping hole in my heart  And all memories of you  Turned painful  Not joyous  As they once were  And the things I used to do with you  Only bring memories  Which I can’t push away  Why did you go?   I just love to procrastinate  I call myself a master at it  I can hear the heartbeat of the clock  As time goes on, bit by bit   My world is bright  With different colors   Dogs are happy  Dogs are brown  Dogs are creamy coloured  Dogs are black   Chocolate is yummy and brown  Chocolate goes in your throat and down  Chocolate has sugar and milk  Chocolate can feel like silk  Chocolate is white or dark  Chocolate can be the colour of bark   The aeroplane rests at  His home – the hangar  At the airport. He is as   Pancakes are my favourite.  Epic is what I like.  Not everything I like to eat.  Elephant I’d like to be.  Lollipops are what I like to eat.  Old is not my age.  Penelope is my name.  End of the poem.   Poets are brilliant,  Poets are good,  Poets are creative,  Poets have a great mood.   As you cut yourself a slice,  You see the chocolatiness inside,  Then the filling oozes out,  As you put it in your mouth,  You taste the cake,  It melts straight away,  Feeling warm,  Moving down your throat,  When it hits your tummy,  Yum you think.   As big as a mountain,  As furry as a cotton ball,  As scary as Dracula,  Strong like Hulk,  As smart as a genius,  Silly like a clown,  As tall as a building,  Shiny like a crown.   Night is when you sleep,  Day is when you’re awake,  The sun goes down and night comes,  The moon goes down back to where it was,  Night and day never meet,  Night and day,  You are awake then asleep.   You open the page,  ‘chapter one’  It says.  You start to read,  You imagine a picture  In your head.  The book is about mythical creatures,  Trolls, giants or maybe a minatour!  As you dig deeper,  You soon find,  That an hour has passed,  In no time!   Just from a seed,  Growing up,  Leaves attached  To every branch,  The wind is whistling,  Dancing with each breath of the wind,  Covered in bark,  Creatures living in  Each nook and cranny  Of the trees.   Glowing, shining,  Like it is smiling,  Screw it in,  Flick the switch,  On it comes,  So quick!   The world feels grey  When all is lost  Still, hope is determined.  It takes a paintbrush  And allows you to  See the world  In a different light.  It colors the trees  The orchards and gardens  It colors the sky  The birds and clouds  It colors the forests  The animals and insects  It allows you to start again  On a blank canvas   Sikim, Sikim where are you?  Are you in the kitchen  or in the bathroom?  Are you sad or happy?  Ah…he is sleeping.   The hill had a brown head.  Green grass gave him  Green hair. The hill  Was a beautiful place.  He had butterflies and   In the rainforest there are amazing creatures…   Tick tock  I can hear a clock  Numbers all around  Meaning different times  Tell the time on a clock  Seconds  Minutes  Hours  The lot!  O’clock  Half past  Quarter past  Quarter to  We have time to make sure you  Never end up late  Never are too early  Never sleep in  Or get up early  Tick tock  I can hear a clock  Twenty to  Twenty past  Ten to  Ten past  Tick tock tick tock   Very red lava  Odd fire sparking up  Lines of lava crackling  Crashing rocks  Ash popping  Never go inside  Okay! Don’t touch lava   The metal fence on the side  Of the road is of iron. It is  A superhero, it saves cars from   At the centre of the city,  There are four buildings that rise.  They stare at you with eyes  As sharp as the ones of a detective  While you stand on the cemented   Your poem didn’t appear, Tisharn. Maybe you used emojis?  They cancel out all the other words. Try again.   Cricket voice make me slip.  for that I make a flip.   The day is rainy.  The garden is so grainy.  The road is floody.  The water colour is so bloody.   Stars gleam bright like you  Shining stars  Shining stars  Gleam bright like you  Do not walk away  You are special  Yeah!  Special!  SHINING STARS!   Family is most important because  They look after you  They feed you  They help you  They love you  All you need is your family  Do not judge   Home, home, sweet home,  Roam, roam home  Home, home, roams, roam  Home sweet home  Home sweet home   Lapland is fun  Lapland is for every one.  There is only one fun Lapland  that can give you the chance to see Santa.  So why not go?  Because I don’t have to  It is fun  Do I have to?  Yes. So go, go, go,  now, now, now – okay?   Proud of my school  Whenever I look at it  I feel a gush of affection  And elation  Gardens upon gardens  And each fragrance  Is pleasant  But unique  Like the children  Studying in the school  And there can only be one person  Responsible  For this masterpiece  She is the soul of the school  Generation of students  She watched them grow  Teaching them  And now us  Values  Which we will never forget  To you, principal Kamini Bhasin  I present  My eternal gratitude   It’s my birthday today  I can’t wait  Presents being opened  And Cake being cut  It is the best day of the year  YEAH   When you are walking on  The busiest road in town,  You see innumerable street  Lights shining at you. Cars go   At the end of this beach,  There is a cave. Nobody knows   day decider  plant grower  earth blazer  sky heater  shadow caster  snow melter  slow turner  skin tanner  yes I am good  no lies  that you shall call…  sun shine   I am not my looks  I am not my heavy make up  Or my fanciful dress  I am not the talent that God gifted me with  I am not my fake smiles  Or my flawless skin  Or the person in the movie  For I merely act as them  Act like I am perfect  And ironically  That’s what makes me imperfect   As I drive in the countryside,  I see some hot-air balloons being readied  At the roadside. Hot-air is being put into them  Which is as light as helium. One of them is   Do you know who I am?  You could not possibly  For I do not know myself  Am not aware of the darkness in my heart  But I do know this  That I am my personality  I am my way of thinking  I am my second nature  I am my friends  That is me   There is a place I like to go,  A place of wonder.  I wonder why trees are green,  I wonder why the tower of Pisa leans,  I wonder why the sky is blue,  I wonder why we wear shoes,  I wonder why the sun is there,  I wonder why people stare,  I wonder why earth is brown,  I wonder how we learnt to frown,  I wonder why there are clouds in the sky,  I wonder why…   The cat  With the cricket bat  Was at  The boat hire   I am going to take the subway.  So, I am at the station.  As I walk to the platform,  I see a dustbin.  It is as empty as the stomach  Of a homeless person who  Has not eaten for a week.   We reach the top of the mountain.  It is as brown as wood from a tree.  My Labrador sits on the peak.  We can see hills below covered  With green grass. My dog feasts   His eyes are red, red like fire,  His wings are giant, giant like a parachute,  His roar is ear piercing, ear piercing like a scream,  His claws are sharp, sharp like a Knight’s sword,  His stare is evil, evil like maleficent,  Dragon   Oh, Macbeth!  I lose myself in your hazel eyes,  your shrewd ideas are very wise.  I wish you were mine.  your army is very fine.  Oh, Macbeth!   Some you have known forever  Others not so long  Maybe you have known them  Since you were 3 or 1 or 2  Whatever  Your best friend   You are in a dark room.  There is a door that is closed  All the time. There is a square window  Also. It is as big as the head of a  Teenager. It is your only   Pandas, birds, tigers, bears  All sorts of different animals  I love animals   Spring is coming,  The sun is rising,  In the clear blue sky,  The birds are flying up so high!  Rabbits hop,  Chickens peck,  And lambs are being born,  It is Easter time,  Excited children,  Flowers are growing tall and proud,  Bright colours all around,  Hear the bees buzz,  See the butterflies flutter,  The sun is shining brightly.   On Sunday we got a new puppy  He runs around everywhere  As mad as he can be  But sometimes he is a bit naughty  And on the carpet he does a wee!   A spiderweb was on the wall.  It was as big as the palm  Of an adult’s hand. A black spider   I sit down at the table  And what is that I can smell?  The lovely roast chicken  With potatoes, gravy and carrots  Broccoli and cabbage too  But forget about all of that because…  It’s all about the chicken food!   I gently tap on your window  I chase away the cold  I come and the warmth follows  The Sun shines brightly  On my flowers  Along with the cool breeze  Tickling your skin  The grass feels luminous  The roses and violets  Blossom when I am around  Animals wake up  After a long sleep  Everyone cheers for me  For I am the Spring  That brings a smile   She hunts with me  She plays with me  She does the same thing as me  She has all sorts of things like me  She paints with me  I love my granny  She’s the best in the world   Friendship is cool  because your friends are always on your side  Like Cherry, Chloe, Ciennah, Ema,  Mereana, Nyra, Eliza, Tisharn, Lakesha,  Adelade and Taimana  They are such fun to play with  and they’re cool with me.   There is darkness  In each one of us  A tendency to kill  A desire for pain  A hunger for suffering  A greed for more  A blindness to honesty  A thirst to choose wrongly  Nobody is flawless  But to shroud that darkness  With light  Is what makes a person  Perfect   People hate cats,  People love dogs,  People hate numbers,  People love letters,  People hate other people,  I love you,  You love me.   Sometimes the truth can be hard  Hard to consume  Hard to digest  Hard to move on from  But it is the truth  Conceal it  And you only delay the pain  Conceal it  And you only feel guilty  Conceal it  And you have to tell a thousand more lies  And yet despite this  Sometimes it is necessary  Crucial  To make sure the person does not run away  From the bitter truth  Sometimes it’s better to lock it away   You feel different from the rest,  you want to get something off your chest,  you feel all twitchy when you are around people,  people you don’t know,  everything has to be perfect,  no red and blue mixed up,  no crisp packets opened the wrong way around,  you are not comfortable in a crowd,  you like to be alone,  you are always quiet  and only talk when asked.   Hi Rosie, there’s no poem here. Roast chicken was blank, too. Just a title.   On my way to feed the cattle in the morning sun,  Two collie dogs following, nipping at the cattle’s feet,  The calves are bleating,  Hens are laying,  Seven cats roaming around,  Ducks waddling in a line,  Following the drake as they go!  Moo, Quack, Woof, Meow,  Life of a farm girl.   There is someone special in my life,  that someone will hug me tight,  they’d hug me tight if I were scared,  they’d hug me tight  so I’d know they’re there,  they’re there for me when times are bad,  when times are good or bad,  I’m scared I’d say,  they’d hug me tight,  I’m scared I’d say,  they’d hug me tight,  when times are good or bad, when times are good or bad.   In the rainforest there are amazing creatures,  Animals who would probably gobble up teachers,  Predator and prey,  Who roam around the forest every day   Mindfulness  you don’t play  you can sleep  up on my hay  you can do it in the day  do it at night  maybe when It is bright  it is up to you  and you and you and YOU  I understand you want to be  in a pool  the mindfulness  makes you feel cool   School is cool  because I learn skipping  go noddle and boxing  I can do all of it  I like writing a poem  I can learn much  Reading is cool to practice   I don’t want to go.  There’s nothing to do  then there’s no one to talk to  nothing to do  there’s nothing to play with  I’ll stay in the car  I don’t want to go in  Please!!!  OK  I’ll have some cake  Hey, this is great cake  I can extend to some really good stamps  Is this eyeballs Eyewear Story Bridge   School is cool  because we learn math  science and writing  and at school I play  with my friends  They were kind and they asked  if I could play with them   If I had a phone,  I’d be with it alone.   I am waiting for a yellow bus  Between green grass and the  Stony road. It is early morning.  The fog is as thick as smoke.  There is no bus stop.   Dark clouds,  Dark sky,  Everything so misty and dry,  From the mountain so far but near.   I wake up early in the morning.  While yawning, I get surprised.  The first sight I see is that  Of a pigeon trapped in the blue  Net I had used to make sure   While writing a poem  I forget a comma.  It may be just a very,  Very small bracket,  But it is still very important.  You need to respect its power.  The comma is very powerful.  I can say the same sentence  In three different ways:  Shoot him don’t kill him.  This doesn’t make sense,  It’s wrong grammar.  I can say the same sentence  This way too:  Shoot him, don’t kill him.  It is grammatically correct.  You should know its meaning.  You can also say the same sentence  This way also:  Shoot him don’t, kill him.  You can say it is wrong grammar  Or that it sounds colloquial.  But you can still understand  The sentence’s meaning.  The absence, presence and location  Of this very, very small bracket  Is very, very important.  It has the power to make  A sentence grammatically correct.  It can also make a sentence  Grammatically wrong.  The absence too can do so.  It has the power to change the  Meaning of a sentence too.  No wonder, this small bracket:  The comma is all-powerful.  Don’t underestimate it.  Don’t think that  It is a titular punctuation.  It has power and it uses it.  Just respect the power  Of this very, very small bracket  Which we all call the comma.   The icy garden was cold.  Gentle snow flakes dropped down  like a big fluffy cloud  that the frosty wind blew at you.  Crusty snow settled like a crunchy malteser.  It was great fun to play with my mum.  We made a soft snowman,  we had a huge snowball fight  and when I was cold  we snuggled inside  with a hot cup of soup.   I am at the railway station.  I am travelling. I see the digital  Signs. The train will be here  Very soon. It should  Come and stop in a little while.  I open my bag to remove  My wallet keep it above  The telephone box.  My wallet contains coins.  I use a coin to call mother.  ‘Hi Mother! I’m at the station.  The train will be arriving soon.’  I hang up.  The train arrives.  I hurry.  It stays only for a short while.  I don’t want to miss it.  I board the train.  It starts.  But then I look out  Of the window. I see my wallet  Sitting on the telephone box.  I forgot to take it  Before entering the train.  It had my train ticket.  Looks like I am going  To have a very tough time  Very, very soon.   Words are like a sword  A tool in our hand  They can be used as a sharp dagger  To hurt anyone  And cause pain and harm or drama  Or like a healing medicine  To soothe anyone  To make them happy again  Words aren’t evil or good  That depends on the wielder   Opps…   Some say destiny is a string  A straight path  That you have to blindly follow  That you have to trust   In this dry desert I live.  There is a house made  Of brick. It is painted  Red and white.  It’s where I live.  It is my beautiful house.  Every day I wake up in  A pool of sweat.  I am bathed in sweat  Every single moment.  There’s no electricity.  There’s no way to beat the  Heat and evaporate sweat.  Sweat trickles down the body  Every single moment.  It makes you itch  Every single inch  of your body.  But at the end of the day,  It’s life for me.  In this dry desert I live.   A new home is fun  a new home is scary, believe me  please don’t be weary  It’s sometimes jolly  but when it’s the wrong home  I don’t think you will have a fun life   The sky is blue  roses are red  the grass is green  the sun is yellow  the wind is whistling  birds are chirping.   The sky is grey  The clouds are white  The rain drops are blue  Roses are red  The grass is green  So a rainbow is a rainbow   Mum, where are my shoes?  Um, where ever you left them  But where was the last place I had them?  I don’t know   Fun times with friends  is always a good time  to have fun and not to cry   Imagine there was freedom to believe,  Soldier attacking me and asking me to leave,  I was in a cell there and then,  Surrounded by a bunch of criminal men   On the sand I saw a shell,  the shell had been washed up by the tide.  I said, “Come, shell, come.”  But the shell, as if by magic, flew away,  and was taken far, far away,  right to the other side of the ocean.  I wonder if the shell will reach my grandad,  far, far away,  right to the other side of the ocean.  Maybe he will find it one day.   I started running  Across the streets, at night  My eyes open  Arms swaying back and forth  Like a train  Running on the roads  Houses passing by  Trees go behind  Soon,  Everything I see is a blur  Parks, gardens, street lights  All smudged up together  And I have a sharp pain in my side  With tiring lungs  And a wheezing heart  I force my tormented feet  To keep moving  Sweat races down my cheek  As I stop to gasp for breath  Winded and spent  I know that I am  Exhausted   The world feels grey  When all is lost  Still, hope is determined  It takes a paintbrush  And allows you to  See the world  In a different light  It colors the trees  The orchards and gardens  It colors the sky  The birds and clouds  It colors the forests  The animals and insects  It allows you to start again  On a blank canvas   What thay want,  Is all I need,  All I feel  All I think  The place to be  They spoke to me  I couldn’t see  They told me that I needed to just be me  I was confused  I didn’t know  That they could see what I can’t  They spoke to me  What they want is all I need  All I feel  All I think  The place to be  They told me to reveal myself  I said to them that they had to reveal themselves  But they didn’t…  And now i hear  GHOSTS  And now I hear  GHOSTS  They speak to me  They speak to me  GHOSTS  They speak to me.   Roses R red  Violets R blue  Come into the hood  And I’ll have watermelon and KFC with you  If U think I’m lying I live outside of it  So look on Google Maps and look at my address   Unicorns, unicorns  Never! of course they’re real  Imagine how you would feel  Cause you have met the most amazing thing in the land  Oh, watch her tottle along, kicking the sand  Royal beauty you see  Nothing better than she  Something special about this one, her name is Rainbow and she loves you all !!!!   I feel like writing a poem  But I don’t have any good ideas.  I’ll copy one of my friend’s poems  And submit it online as my own.  I know it’s called Plagiarism and  It’s unethical to copy someone  Else’s poem, but who’ll find out?  Nobody’s going to know I did so.  Except for my friend if he finds  Out and me obviously. So I go  online and go to the webpage  Where I had to submit the poem.  Then I realized that it’s a bad  Thing to plagiarise. So I do the  Next best thing. I gave the credit  To the person who wrote it,  And submitted it after adding  Some more lines to the poem.  I also quoted those copied lines  So that those who see it know  I’m innocent and only indulge  In ethical activities.   Father Christmas duck is having a rest.  At eating, Sharky is the best.  Snappity is drifting closely by  And the lid is as blue as the sky.  The bubbles have now all gone flat.  Wet footprints can be seen trodden in the mat.   I like to invent  Make things in my mind  Give life  To the things  That never existed  Create dreams  For people  Who will never be  I like to invent  But what I can’t invent  Is hope  For you  That you  Find the courage  And invent it  Yourself   That melody  Soothing to the ear  Brings up pictures in my mind  Slow and melodious  Sometimes speedy and noisy  With people screaming  And banging  And rapping  I love music   We work together  Don’t need words  To communicate  We work efficiently  We know each other  Know what we are going to do  Know each other’s moves  We need each other  We lend each other our strength  We pick each other up  When we fall down  We are closer than friends  We are a team   I did not know  That it was possible  To get nightmares  When I am awake  Until you came along  You made me laugh  Made me reveal secrets  I dare not think about  Made me feel at home  I feel so content around you  But when I am not  I cringe  At the things I told you  And I vow  To never talk to you again  But your twinkling eyes  And your easy smile  Makes me falter  And I crack up  Laughing at all your jokes  And thoughts about you  Are dreams  As well as nightmares   Sunshine shining bright  U make me so warm  No way I prefer wind  Shine brighter than ever before  Hide from the sun, clouds  I don’t like you  NO, NO, NO, I don’t like you  End your weather clouds, wind and rain   Tyan  Is better than any footballer  Has more than a Million pounds  Can run further than anyone  Can jump higher than anyone or any animal  Even a lion.  Tyan.   Today was amazing  Today was sunny  Today I was happy  And I had the best day ever   Everyone has a fear  But that does not make them cowards  For the one who is fearless  Is the one  Who fears fear itself   Sometimes I wish to be lost  Lost in my own world  I like to drift off  To a land which does not exist  I feel comfortable there  I feel at home  I do not wish to be found again  For this world feels like a prison  And sometimes  I just want to escape reality   Loud is not the music  That is banging on the radio  Loud are not the people screaming  Loud are not the babies wailing  Loud are not the bird screeches  Loud are not the children shouting  No, not to me   Christmas Day is here!,  I woke up so early,  I got out of bed and rushed downstairs,  I saw all my presents under the tree, there were hundreds!  Even I forgot it’s Christmas Dinner today!,  When I rushed downstairs I looked down at the tree  but it was 5 a.m. but I am going to open some, actually all of them!,  Do you want to know what are my presents?  Okay I’ll tell you!  I got a new trampoline  A toy campervan  and sweets and chocolate  Mmmm!  My favourite.  Now it’s Christmas Dinner time!  Join in!  Shall I tell you what I had?  I had brownies for pudding, turkey, potatoes and salad.  Yum!,  Oh, I love Christmas Day!   People lover,  human hugger,  goal keeper,  human taker,  human maker,  but just for now it’s me   Books are great  Oh I love them  oh you should too. It’s the  Key to reading   Reading is fun!,  Eating when you’re reading is not allowed!  All of us love reading!,  Drinking juice will make your book wet!,  I love reading, it’s my favourite!,  Now when you finish the book you will get another one!,  Get another book and starting reading again!,   I saw a bear,  Who was in tear,  It hurts its hand,  Sitting in the sand.   It is Bonfire Night!,  There is lots of light!,  Some of us had a fight!,  But I didn’t,  I was looking at the beautiful rocky moon like it’s a knight in shining armour,  Bonfire Night is great but it’s hard to sleep!,  The colourful fireworks shining bright tonight!,  Exploding up and up into the sky showing the brightness it can show!,  Making everybody having fun and enjoying the night!,  It’s late now everybody has to go to sleep!,  The fireworks ended, it was silent and quiet and nothing talked through the whole night except cars and motorcycle driving through the street,  It was just silence,  Everybody went to sleep so they could recharge their energy for tomorrow!,   In our night time classroom  I see pencils and pens gliding to the rock brick wall,  Drawing my name, it is creepy and very scary.  I hear the cupboard opening and slamming,  SLAM!SLAM!SLAM!  In our night time classroom,  I hear the tables crashing and breaking the pencils in half!  I hear the chairs breaking the pens, and the blood ink floating to the ground,  I hear the trees bashing the door and windows trying to get in,  I see scissors snapping like a crocodile and trying to hurt me.  I see my teacher coming in  to our night time classroom.  I hide behind the cupboard  Then everything goes back to normal,  The broken pencils and pens jumping into the bin,  The trees walking back where to they live,  The chairs and tables hopping back into place  Everything returns to normal,  That was very scary and creepy  In our night time classroom,  In our night time classroom,  In our night time classroom!   I love Prodigy,  Prodigy is the best,  Prodigy is good,  Prodigy is bad.   Giraffes are tall  But some of them call   You seem to have forgotten to include the poem, Lydia. Send it again.   Seeing your face again  I get this huge lump in my throat  A chance that we might never meet again  Is enough to shatter me  And although in front of you  I try to act strong  Inside I am struggling  My brain tells me to let it go  For the more time I spend with you  The stronger the pain will be  But my heart does not want to stop  It does not want to move on  It does not want to let go  And with a huge smile plastered on my face  I look at you  And I cannot bring myself to say goodbye   Errrrrr…. EAT MEEEEEEE,  THE BEE STUNG MEEEE,  TO MAKE HONEYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!  I’M HUNGRRYYYYYYYY,  EEEEAAAATTTT MMMMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!  Did I really have to do that?!  Lol!  Oooh, I like licking the butter you always splash on me!  End!   Thou who planted the forest  are loved with tender care  thou is great  or we would be dead  thanks to all thou  who earned my trust  for this is not an orchard but a forest   Salty scenter,  Lip licker,  Microwave jumper,  Paper scruncher,  In your face flicker,  Cinema snacker,  WHAT AM I?   Names,  They are like flavoured candy canes,  They come in different types,  And can be turned into hypes.   Courage is not about  Not being scared  Only fools are not scared   I am walking in a dark alley.  Nothing moves. Everything is still.  And then in the still world  Comes out a green snake.  He is a scary snake.  He comes in front of me.  His sharp tongue is shaped  Like the letter V and as red  As the blood that is getting  Pumped out of my heart  The moment I see him.  Don’t panic. Don’t panic  Were the words of my soul.  I could stamp the ground.  It could scare the snake away.  But what if because of the  Fear, it pounces on me  Like a tiger pounces on  A rabbit. It then may even  Inject its venom into my blood  Resulting in my death. No chance.  Well, no need to panic.  My soul assures me.  An animal only attacks  Another animal if it is harmed  I didn’t cause any  Harm to the scary snake.  So I walk backwards as fast  As I can. If the snake comes  After me, I’ll stamp the ground.  Lucky for me, he doesn’t come  After me. I’ll never take this  Road ever again. If I do,  The memory of this incident  Will haunt me with the imagination  Of the snake. That is even if he’s  Not in the road.  ‘Cause I’ll be thinking  That he’s waiting in the still bush  Waiting to pounce on me and scare  Me so that I get a heart attack.   Crazy dog  Spanky dog  Nice Labrador dog  No dog   If you want to catch a monkey  you will guarantee to fail  until you learn to leap  whilst swinging by your tail   Harry the shark was scared of the dark  He didn’t know what to do  He had a very strong heart  but was cheeky at the end of the day   Lovin’ it, is what I will say  While riding a lovely horse, Neigh!  It is what I say when it is finally May!  This is what I say when I get a piggy back  from my bro Shay!  This is what I say while getting my make up done  by my sis Fay!  Lovin’ it.   I love chocolate  chocolate brownies  cookies  cake  milkshake  hot chocolate  sprinkles  eggs  and of course chocolate milk  Wish there was a land of chocolate  where you could eat anything!   Hello foxy, hello cow!  Loads and loads of beautiful animals.  Hello hamster, hello hedgehog!  All of those animals to choose from !  I love every one of them   Meow, said the sly cat with a sneaky grin  Squeak! The cute hamster said happily nibbling  and admiring another hamster.  The cat sat in front of the beautiful view and said  Aren’t I the most beautiful cat?  Oi! the other hamster shouted,  stop blocking the most beautiful view!  How rude, the cat hissed, I’m off!  The two Hamsters fell in love  and soon got married.  They had two babies called Herbert and Effy   Easter, and who doesn’t love  <strong>A</strong> lovely egg hunt to go on?  See a blue one, see a red one and a rainbow one over there.  To see an egg in the garden, how nice is that?  Easter is the best  Ready for it again!!!!!!   One pound a muffin,  two pound a pancake,  three pound an orange,  four pound a sausage.   Sisters are annoying,  They make us boys want to run.  Although they are horrible  Sometimes they can be fun  But still us boys are the best  Though we sometimes need to rest!

The sky is blue  Water is blue  Blue is cool  Because it’s the color of the pool  I like blue  But why it’s not the color of my shoe?   I wish I was a monkey who can swing from tree to tree.  I wish I could eat bananas for my tea.  I wish I was a monkey with a monkey family.  I wish I was monkey that lived in a tree.  I wish I was a monkey that could play all day long.  I wish I was a monkey that could sing a monkey song.

I’ve named a girl, a boy and even a tree,  I’ve got a name, you’ve got a name, everyone’s got a name.  You might have a weird name, a nice name or even a bad name  But we all have a names.  Your name might be Jes,  Your name might be Blush,  Your name might be something no one knows.  I love my name.  You should love your name too.   Firemen are quite helpful,  Vets are very exciting,  Hair dressers are very chatty,  Nurses are very serious,  Zookeepers are happy,  Gardeners are quite particular,  Car washers are hard working,  Dentists are amazingly clever.   I wish I was a ballerina dancing in the spotlight.  I wish I could fly in the everlasting air.  I wish I was on my way to a professional ballet school,  with a barr, a mirror and a pool.   Green O’ green is the colour of the fresh grass,  Pink O’ pink is the colour of tiny flowers,  Yellow O’ yellow is the colour of the shining sun,  Purple O’ purple is a metallic dragon flying,  Red O’ red is the colour of my beating heart,  Brown O’ brown is the colour of a homely tree trunk,  Blue O’ blue is my favourite colour of them all  And is the colour of a waterfall.   It’s time,  time for SATS  There are butterflies in my stomach,  so remember,  It’s time.   Look, look there’s a cat  Look, look there’s a car  Look, look there’s a new park  Can we go pleeeeeeeese?   Mom is kind  mom is helpful  mom is amazing  mom is like the moon  dad is kind  dad is sweet  dad is handsome  dad is like the sun  and I love them   A unicorn is fluffy  A unicorn is sweet  Unicorns are my favourite  I wish I could meet  a fluffy sweet unicorn   I remember the time when I first made friends  I remember the time I met my new cousin  and I also remember time when I had a guinea-pig   I wish I could soar,  I wish I could fly,  I wish I was a bird  high up in the sky,  I wish I could take a poem  wherever I go.   Day sky, day sky, reflect on the water  Day sky, day sky, get the clouds whiter  Day sky, day sky, get the sun smiling  Day sky, day sky, do what you do   In the garden I see  a beautiful butterfly looking at me  and I also see  a little fast buzzing bee staring at me   I love my brother because he makes me laugh,  I love my brother because he helps me practice  for gymnastics competitions,  I love my brother because he loves me,  I love my brother just because I do.   Roar, roar, roar is what a ferocious lion does.  Squeak, squeak, squeak is what a hyper Guinea-pig does.  Oink, oink, oink is what an irritated pig does.  Meow, meow, meow is what a beautiful cat does.  Ha, ha, ha is what we do.   Twinkly stars  shining on the moon,  the sun is down,  all in bed.  The moon is up,  the stars are twinkling with light,  now I’m done and so is the day.   Bears go tap  fish go splash  parrots go crunch  dogs growl   Camel, camel  with a big hump  I wonder if they can jump  like us.   Clouds are fluffy  clouds are puffy  there are millions  or maybe billions.   I wish I was a puppy  I wish I could listen to my music  I wish I could listen to the smooth sea  I remember when I saw my sister  It’s a secret but I hate dark chocolate  On Tuesday I saw the sun  In a week I promise to have lots and lots of fun   The stars are very beautiful  shining bright in space  they glisten and twinkle  putting a smile on my face   It’s so sunny today  I must stay indoors.  I really want to go outside,  the garden looks so beautiful  when it’s glistening in the sun.  I still can’t go outdoors,  no matter if I plead and beg.  Now it’s the end of the day,  so goodbye folks   i wish I was a mermaid  I wish I could hear the waves in the sea  I wish I could see the sun rise  I don’t want it to be a secret but I won’t keep it as a secret  I promise I will keep my powers safe if my wish comes true  Tomorrow I will keep my energy for my swimming  Somehow I feel like I am connected to the sea   With all the flowers shining  Light it up  The stars are a bright light tonight   Snake was bored  Very bored  He decided to explore  On his way he found a…  BEAR!  He slithered as fast as he could  Snake was no longer bored   I wish I was a seagull,  I wish I could fly,  I wish I could remember everything that was today  I wish I could take a poem wherever I go  but this is the end of the day, so I must go   Under the sea there’s colourful coral,  Under the sea there’s a life full of creatures,  Under the sea is where wishes come true,  Under the sea is where I can talk to you.   Life of a turtle is very, very slow,  life of a cheetah is really fast,  life of a dolphin is very long,  life of a squirrel is short,  life of a badger is very rough,  life of a wolf is very easy,  and my life is amazing.   At night my mum reads me a story,  At night my mum makes me a glass of milk  At night my mum tucks me up nice and warm  At night I dream what the next day will be like.   I glance at the figure next to me  Still and lifeless, limp like a doll  Can’t bear to look at his dull, emotionless eyes  It hurts to think about  That gaping hole in my heart  Bitter taste of bile in my mouth  And my head spins giddily  Every part of my body aching  My jaw burns  As I try to hold back tears  And I force myself to look at him again  And I hope  That he is at peace  And I know  That one day, I will join him   My heart is as bright as the sun  My soul is as powerful as the Queen  My muscles are as strong as a lion  But my eyes are as good as an owl’s  My legs are as long as a giraffe   Once there was a snowball  I picked it up to throw  but i felt very sad  so took the snowball inside  I made it my new friend  but when the sun came out  it started to melt  so when it did melt  I was very sad  so I made my own snowball  out of paper   I wish I could soar through to the sun  I wish I could live forever  It is a secret but I love donuts  I remember when I was a tiny baby  On the weekends I saw my family  Tomorrow I will have a good time   Night sky, night sky  you’re beautiful in midnight  but your stars  can they shine glamorous in the sky?  Oh please, oh please, oh one thing  you’re beautiful like a diamond in the sky  Oh, oh, oh  You’re beautiful like a diamond  in the sky  Yeah yeah (beautiful singing)   I wish I wasn’t a human being like you and I  I wish I couldn’t listen to my annoying music every time  I wish I couldn’t have a sister annoying as a you AND I  Can I just say that I remember the time  when you and I said our first word at the same time  I just want to not be the same as you all time   I love it when my mom  kisses me good night  she is just like the like the stars  that shine so bright  I love to do gymnastics and play football  when I was younger I couldn’t even kick a ball  I love lollipops and chocolate too  I especially love Aeros and a Bounty too  I love spar parties because they are fun and excite me  I love to write poems as you can see   I wish, I wish I could be a star shining above everybody  I have have got a secret but don’t tell anybody  Here it goes…  I wish I was a boy because they are really cool  (except my brother Alex he is a fool)  Remember this is our secret  and remember not to tell anybody  I am trusting you now  If you tell anybody I won’t be your friend   When you are sad  go and play with your friends.  If your friends aren’t there.  play with your family.   your footsteps go tap tap  your laugh goes ha ha ha  your claps go clap clap clap  your smile goes silent  your life is so full of sound   I wish I was a princess of the UK,  I wish I could listen to my favourite band,  I wish I could see a new born cub,  It is a secret but I HATE ice-cream,  I remember the first time I met my nephew,  On Monday I saw the glamorous snow,  Tomorrow I promise to have lots of fun.   Life is beautiful  and great with flowers  I love my Mum forever   Flowers are beautiful  and smell like perfume  What a wonderful life.  It smells like love  in the garden.   Through a looking glass, I see,  Something like a feathery flea!  It jumped inside the teapot,  Actually stayed on its spot.  Fell asleep in my tea.   What comes from the sky  From the sky to the earth?  Rain comes from the sky  From the sky to the earth  What comes from the earth  From the earth to the sky?  Plants come from the earth  From the earth to the sky   Stoic enjoys risky moves.  Travels through time and space.  Oddly, he has a secret pet.  Ice cream gives him rashes.  Collects cartoon stickers.  McNair is his interesting last name.  Cooks the world’s best spaghetti bolognaise.  Nothing scares him.  Accidentally lost the key to his teleporter.  Ideas come to him quickly.  Rides skateboards like a superstar.   I open the door  Of my home  After all, the sun  Looks like a tennis  Ball today and  I like going outside.  So, I wear my hat  And open the door  To go out.  I’ll lie on the grass.  Wait! What is that  Thing under the door?  It’s a lizard.  Is the lizard dead?  I lunge downwards to  See it. It runs out.  Ok! It is isn’t dead.  It runs into a bush.  It may come back.  So I almost close the door  So that the lizard can’t get in.  After all, my mother is  Scared of them.  So I almost close the door  And lie on the grass  To sunbathe.   In the dance,  mum was in a trance.  Dad was slap-happy,  even that was casually!   The plug socket  sat patiently,  waiting for his friend,  longing to share his electricity.   Have any of you  Seen this movie  Called the Theory  Of Everything?  It’s about this person.  This person, who gets  A rare neuron disease.  Doctors told him he would  Die from the disease.  But did he? He didn’t.  He went on to make discoveries  And the best part was  With this disease!  Can you believe that?  About the universe we are in  A few years ago  A website crashed  Thanks to him.  He’s not a hacker though.  People just wanted to read  This paper that was made  Public on this website.  But, the sad thing’s that  He passed away recently.  Yes, that’s true.  His name was Stephen Hawking  He flew to heaven a few days ago.  And this poem is just  A small tribute  To this great man.   This is Teddy  Teddy says, Hi…   Morgan’s hands might be  As rough as sackcloth.  After all, he’s a blacksmith  But when he bathes  His children, his hands  Turn themselves into flowers  And become as soft as  A pillow made by  A luxury bedding company.   For me, computers are old  So, Windows 10 was created,  Now leave me be.   Magnificent  Optimistic  Terrific  Hardworking  Entranced  Responsible   Ice cream is yummy  Ice cream is great  Sometimes I get it on my nose   I have zero friends,  I have zero pets,  I have zero everything,  But I have one friend  You   Dawn to Dusk  The scarlet Sun  Shining over the hills  Showing the first of its  Golden rays  The dark, pale night  Turns into a  Crimson red sky  Glowing beams  Spread across the city  As the sky turns blue  With a tint of yellow   0. Around and round and round we go,  When we get home we make a zero.   Blue is a blue bird flying in the sky.  Blue is a bluebell growing on the grass.  Blue is a sadness you get inside and want to cry.  Blue is a blueberry growing on a bush.  Blue is the ocean  Blue is the sky  Blue is sometimes the sea  All right, there are so many things that are blue.  It’s a huge colour  Can you imagine living without it?   Cherry, orange, strawberry,  Oh how so merry,  Danger might give you a fright…  …but maybe not tonight.   Shrinking, I fall into a rusted web-like key hole  But inside there is something different  Green giant leaves  Spotty ladybirds on the leaves  Colourful flowers  Frosted fields  And a lot more  My bulging eyes could not even blink  I did not know about it  I never believed.   The rose is as red a blood,  As rugged as thorns,  As sharp as a needle,  Deadly as nightshade.   Sunday is a funday  of course next to Monday  and funday is a day  on Sunday   Give me a hug and a kiss  or you might be in a lot of trouble  which will turn you  into a bubble   When we were 11 months old, we were afraid to take our first steps.  When we were 3, we didn’t know how afraid we’d be of monsters under our bed.  When we were 5, we were afraid to go to kindergarten and leave mommy and daddy.  When we were 7, we were scared to go to the zoo and see the animals roar.  When we were 10, we were afraid to go to middle school.  Now as we grow older, our fears are enhancing…   My doll is little Linda  Who is always with me  She has her hair long  Which I weave everyday.   Books are full of…  Brilliant, Beautiful, Breathtaking things.  Stories are filled with  Scary, Spectacular, Sensational things.  Tales are overloaded with  Troublesome,Truthful, Tiresome things.  Spiels are spoken with  Prideful, Positive and Precise purpose.   Winter is amazing!  It brings snow and other things too.  If you like cold snow and wind  Then you will definitely love winter  Everything is always covered  Always covered with a white soft blanket  This blanket is actually snow  Winter is the best  You will love winter  Because of what it brings   Flip, flap,  The sound of the pages turning.  Whoosh, whoosh,  The sound of the wind howling.  Thump, thump,  The sound of footsteps.  Pitter-patter,  The sound of the rain falling.  Rumble, rumble,  The sound of the thunder.  Clap, clap,  The sound of hands clapping.  Crinkle, crackle,  The sound of leaves being stepped on  Chitter, chatter  The sound of those speaking.  Awooooo,  The sound of the wolves howling.  Drip, drop,  The sound of water dripping.  If there were a sound for silence,  It would be here.  But silence is nowhere,  Sound is all around.  Not a single sound of silence to be ever heard.   Books are fabulous  They take you to amazing worlds  Books are best friends  Near friends  They are cool friends  Some friends you never ever saw before  They are always there  For their friends  They are never rude, mean  Or even cruel  They are the best  At least I think so   Do you know spring?  And what does it bring.  When I take a shower,  I feel like a flower.  Come and see me,  I am above the tree.  Spring will make you happy!  And will never make you sappy.   The stars gleamed in the midnight sky  As the spy  Went to go investigate  The case of the missing skate.   cat cat  bouncing cat  cat cat  silly cat  I love cats   Recently, I’ve seen Santa, the man with white, bushy facial hair,  in festive carols and pantomines everywhere.  I’m delighted Christmas day is close,  I’ve already recieved heaps of Noel post.   Poems can rhyme  poems can relate  poems are fun  don’t make a mIsTaKe!  Poems have rhythm  poems can describe  an object that you decide  You might come up with one on the spot  You might be all day deciding  whether or not it’s a poem  So go ahead and write one  They are great  Poems!   I woke up today  I didn’t know that I would fly away  I asked my mum, ”What is happening now?”  My mum said, ”It’s your birthday now”  I didn’t tell her that I’m in love  but I see, it’s right above  and then after school  I waited at the mall  and I told her that I will fly away  She said, ”Where will you fly today?”  ”I will fly to Japan this way”  she said, ”Yeah I will also fly this way”  and that’s the great love story.   I love my mummy wherever we go,  She makes me happy with a single smile,  I love the mummy I have,  She takes care of me and I take care of her  Then everybody is happy and filled with love.   The first random thing is: WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA…   What should my poem be about?  I dunno!  How about DINOSAURS!  Actually, no!  How about ghosts haunting your house?  How about giants, or how about a mouse?  How about playing on a lovely snowy day?  Or going to the theatre to see a funny play!  Dancing in the living room, listening to The Clash,  Or sitting in the kitchen, eating sausages and mash!  How about Mr. Banana Skin, people stepping on him!  Or, how about somebody going to the gym?  Or, how about…. EVERYTHING!!!!!!!!!

The night sky is black,  with twinkling stars at the back.  What is white? The snow is white,  with shining sunlight.   I know it’s kind of awkward,  but most people must hate school.   Cold breezes reaching for your face,  The soft blanket layering on all surroundings  When you touch it, it’s like a mattress  The icicles forming a beautiful backround  The unique snowflakes landing on your nose.  You’ve never seen such light and airy snow in your village  The perfect snow for skiing on when your ready for it  You know you love it  Because it’s winter.   There was once a mannequin dancing  All down the catwalk it was prancing  Throwing all sorts of moves  It’s really in the groove  And everybody there was glancing   Creamy, milky chocolate taste   I booked a flight  during the night  next morning was too light  I switched off the light and  had a fight with a knight   Going to school might not be fun,  but sometimes not for everyone,  they might like school they might not,  in this case this is a different one,  I am home-educated it’s not what you think,  it’s not play all day and do what you like,  it’s just like school but at home,  you still do work but alone,  your parents help you, guide you along,  did you know you could do your GCSE at 14!  No hassle like at school,  just comfy in your home doing your work!  All along, groups you can go to,  to meet other home ed people,  I love it  Penguin Paradise,  Penguin Paradise so the penguins say,  an icy place with snow and fog  and the skies are mostly grey.

My life is very simple you see,  it is more than just about me.  I’ll laugh, I’ll cry, but I’ll always be  the daughter of some lovely parents!  I have a lot of friends, more than you can count,  they are all lovely, no doubt.  I have an amazing family,  what a wonderful family tree,  and I know one thing for sure,  my life is full of glee!   SMILE and sing for  Miles, everyone  Is individual  Lights you up!  Every day   There was once a girl  Who hurt her toe.  Although it really hurt  She still wanted to sew.  Her sister Arissa  Was five years old.  She never did  What she was told.  Her brother Armaan,  Was very happy.  He was going to be 14  Although he was still flappy.   German planes zooming around,  Dropping bombs upon the ground,  Air raid wardens warn to hide,  While the army build towers in the tide,  Everyone hears the sirens go off,  And when smoke comes from the bombs people start to cough,  Soon the war has ended,  And everything started to get mended,  Now people can live their lives again,  And pray to God, thank you, amen.   He is still lurking in that lake  Waiting to bite off people’s legs  He waits there quietly  Until one day  A human gets into the lake!  The Crocodile snaps  But the human has a weapon to scare him away  He swam for miles with his big smug smile  But he was never seen again  That was the poem of the crocodile!   My birthday has finally come,  I can’t open all of my presents at once!  I’m getting older,  I’m getting taller,  I wonder if I’m getting shorter?  123 shout yippee, because my birthday is today,  I’m on my way,  To freedom,  My future is ahead,  Of me,  I want to be a writer musician or artist one day.

Toe warmer  Candle melter  Sausage maker  Dragon lover  Water hater   Driving along in the tractor  Harvesting crops in the summer  You own lots of tractors  Ford, Massie, John Dear, that is just three of them.  The combine driving along,  Tractor and trailer alongside it,  Feeding the chickens some corn,  Making bales of hay  Wrapping them precisely,  The bales all stacked up,  To fill the cattle all up,  This is the life on a farm!   Misty waves flow into me  The glow of magic is everywhere  You can’t see it but it is there  Believe,  Anything is possible,  Even magic.  Choose a path to follow that leads you to  Feel love,  Friendship.  Smile to everyone and everywhere  You are not alone, magic is with you  It makes your mind explode  It is made by…  SCIENCE!  Feel your magic  It is in you  You just need to  Stay positive and you need  BELIEF.  Magic is everywhere.   Test day,  When the classroom  Always cheerful  Becomes duller.  A corn maze of tables  Students at every end  The clatter of pencils  The tapping of shoes  The flicking of papers  As the test commences  3…2…1 GO!!!  The words on the pages  Bold and clear  Yet my vision  Becomes blurred  As the words on the page  Merge into one  My brain becomes twisted  As I ponder into space  My memory lost  Then suddenly I remember  The whole point of tests  So teachers can teach  And gain some cash.  Soon the tests over  All can relax  Not worry, not care  Because the whole point  Of tests of course  Is to help us learn  And learn some more.   It’s a pterodactyl flying.  It’s a hungry shark chasing a penguin.  It’s a Star Destroyer catching the Rebel Fleet.  It’s an angler fish drifting along.  It’s a sleepy curled up dog.   I am at the sea  There is not a single bee  I can see the sea  Very clearly  On a beautiful day  Being by the bay  As I lay in the sun  It is such fun   It is snowing  The trees are blowing  I can’t believe it is snowing!  Hot chocolate will be nice  As it is cold as ice  AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Banana Bay  Is where I stay  On holiday  On Saturday  I have a lay  On my couch  All day  Where I  Still live  By the bay  What a lovely day!   School trips are different from other places  We went to the zoo  I feel like I was at this school.  But you did not fill it up.  We traveled to our line  Enter the row in the field.  The juicy girl was soft  He said he did not care about being mourned.  They are just stupid animals  And now  The lion’s door opened  And just a parade  And,  I can not see him again.  So go to chimpanzees  Listen to what you say.  I am a detention.   If only I could set my day  To be perfect in every way  I would be the queen  With a big machine  I would name the place Big in base  Loving lace, be the queen  With a big machine  Live my life as a fairly tale,  Because I am not a male,  I am a female  Now I need some sleep  With not a leap  Some cookies and milk and…  PIZZA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Birds flying through the air  sun shining down from there  butterflies flipping  bees buzzing  all in the sky today!   Clouds floating in the air  sun beating down  wind whistling  sun warming  the weather-up and down  the rain is pouring  rainbows fill the air  the weather is so beautiful!   What is Night?  Night is a relaxing time to rest,  It is the best,  Time to be together,  Time to be proud of our own success,  Time to forget fearful fears,  And time for many wonderful things.   Clip clop, clip clop  Horse went clip clop  What’s the matter?  Clip clop.   Yawn, yawn  Rumble, roar  Dad’s mowing the lawn  Pull sheets  On head  Can’t be bothered  “Get out of bed!”  Moan, groan  “Please, no.”  Sigh, sigh  Roll eyes  Punch pillow  Bad day  Things will never go my way  2 more minutes  More like 20  Pow, pow  Zap, zap  Portal appears  In middle of room  Ask me? Portal of doom  Evil dragon  What to do?  Maybe some help?  Any of you?  Grab clothes  Make bed  Hope that I don’t end up dead  Creep out  No sound  Mouth drier than a Summer drought  Exit room  Slam door  Evil dragons?  Don’t have time   So many sweet smells  occurring around  flowers perfume the air  the roses and the violets  the primroses and the iris  all sweet smelling flowers  growing in a row  bees are collecting nectar  from the flower’s center  they take it back to their hive  to make sweet, sugary honey   I live in a house  In the garden there is a shelter for a little mouse  I live near a farm  There are horses full of charm  The cows go moo moo!  And the pigeons who go by go coo coo coo!  Oink oink says the pigs!  With a pig sty full of twigs!  With lots more like new ducks I have never seen before  Everyday I go to a forest!  Like a rainforest  It’s magnificent!  There is creatures there so innocent!  When you go in the trees always rustle!  It’s quiet everything not hustle and bustle!  In the endless forest behind the bush animals peek out!  If it’s your first time you shouldn’t shout!  They slowly step into sight  Don’t worry they wouldn’t bite!  First comes the family of deer  When they come closer they are very clear!  The stag, the dad  If someone attacks his family he gets very mad!  Here comes the mum  She enjoys the humming birds’ hum  Here comes the fawn, the baby of the family  It sniffs the ground calmly  It runs to follow its parents next to me  I smiled with glee  I hugged the fawn!  I wish I could hug it till dawn!  But here comes the squirrel  It likes to twirl!  Its ginger furry coat  It’s very sneaky like a stoat  It likes to climb up tall trees  Being a show off it likes to please!  It came to climb up my shoulder  It was struggling to climb up me like a boulder!  So i lifted him up to have a cuddle!  Then he stood next to the deer  And next to a muddy puddle!  Here comes the hedgehogs, husband and wife  Their spikes I think are as sharp as a knife!  They strolls along  The male is very smart! Honestly he is never wrong!  The wife in hand is very sweet!  She likes her home very neat!  They both really like each other  She wants to become a mother!  They both love eating bugs!  And I gave them two great big hugs!  Here comes the robin  It is quite chubby but not thin!  Sticking out its red breast  Up the tree there is his nest!  There is his wife with her eggs  It walked with its tiny legs!  It tweeted loudly and very high!  I guess it was trying to say hi!  It poked around in the grass  It loves to sing  It tweeted and tweeted like a choir doing brass!  I gave him a hug!  I LOVE THE FOREST!   Our school trip was different to the rest  we had gone to the zoo  You might think I did that with our school  but you didn’t do quite this.  We were on our bus driving through the safari  and entering the lion section.  A girl called Suzy panicked  Mrs Blunt said, don’t worry Suzy  they’re just dumb animals  and at that very moment  the lions plucked open the door  and paraded into the bus  and took Mrs Blunt  She was never to be seen again.  So next time you go to the zoo  be careful what you say  You don’t want to end up like Mrs Blunt   I like Summer…  As scorching as the sun,  As refreshing as a slushie,  As adventurous as rock climbing,  As sweet as strawberries,  As breathtaking as snorkeling,  As temperate as a hot tub,  As relaxing as a sauna,  As shocking as a shark,  As surprising as a scorpion.   When you have a thought  a really good thought  a thought that you want to tell your mum  or your dad  but then it slips away  you say  I know it’ll come back.  But it doesn’t.  Aghhh!  Oh yeah it’s…   What’s that lurking in the lake?  Warm yellow eyes on top of it’s face?  Spiky spines on it’s back,  dark green colour,  sharp pointy teeth inside its mouth,  pond weed covering it scaly body?  Mind out everybody!  Sneaking around is the crocodile!   Cats in a hat  Love them  Cats in a hat  They are great  But how are they great?  What is next?   My brother is very funny  and also as cute as a bunny  He irritates me  but he is like a busy bee  He is quiet cute  but sometimes mute  He likes Harry Potter  but I don’t bother.  He loves cricket  and shouts when it’s a wicket  We wrestle  He whistles  I love my brother for being him  And sometimes he treats me well when I win   Winter synchronization profile by Marine  Beautiful castle created by everyone  Wash the sea  This beach is part of the beach  Know the sea and know the sea  If I ask, what we say is ice   I love to see the winter sports  There are all kinds of sorts  Skiing, hockey, and bobsledding in a skeleton  Fun activities to boost your adrenaline  With cheering in the court  I love the winter sport.   I struggle to listen  to focus  and to listen  but I’m no different to you  I am, but it doesn’t mean I’m not a human  Think about that  if others struggle  put yourself in the position  where you struggle to do those things  Don’t judge others on autism  Think of yourself like it   Crunched up seashells on the sea shore  Brilliant castles made with it all  Washed up by the sea  It’s part of what makes a beach a beach  The sea it meets and the sea meets sky  The sand is what I’m describing if you wondered why!   I aspire to be a famous poet  and write rhyming children’s books and poems  I want to be a poet and I know it  I rhyme all the time!  I also want to be an artist  I’d love to paint a picture of every place  bright and colorful  My brain is full  of ideas  What I want to be!   Hello  My name is H  and I say H words  How’s your Horse doing in a Henry’s yard?  He’s Happy of course.  Haven’t you Heard?   When I went to London I saw the tower of London  Also I saw a lady cower  When I went to London I saw lots of people  and I walked through a pool  I thought I was cool   My time machine is mystical  My time machine is mysterious  My time machine is massive   My kitten is so cute  My kitten is so adorable  My kitten is so beautiful  Come and see my beautiful little kitty   Thanks, sir, for your reply  Thank you, sir, for your reply  Thank you, sir, for your answer  Thank you, fo,r your feedback  Thank you, for, your opinion  Thank you for your idea  Thank you for your opinion  Thank you for your idea  Thank you for your idea,  Thank you for your idea  Thanks for the idea,  Thanks for your consideration  Thanks, sir, for your reply   Someone says  Things like beans today  In search of a tree  filled with joy.  Wait for something to post like me  So… “fall” falls to the earth  People who are “angry” say that they are crazy.  Diplomats like hippo, worried as dodo   clouds floating in the air  as soft as candy floss, pale and pink  different shapes and sizes  bringing lots of surprises  rain, thunder, lightning and snow  all is from the clouds  if you touch  your hand will go straight through   Into space, up on the moon  I wish I was an astronaut  Up, up in the sky  I wish, I wish I was an astronaut  through the sky  I float so high  Fly up into the sky with the spaceship  Wow, I just wish I was an astronaut  I wish, I wish I was astronaut  but I’m too small  What would it be like, flying through the sky?   Friends are great  friends are fun  friends are there  when you are glum  Making memories  messing about  we are all friends  Everyone   I love Christmas, snow come,s Santa comes  I just love Christmas  You get to build a snowman  You get to have a roast  Yum, yum, I love Christmas  I will spend all day opening presents  I just love Christmas  Yum, yum, yum  Christmas dinner, crackers, fun  I love to celebrate Christmas  I love to decorate trees  I just love Christmas   Nature is very beautiful,  For which I am very joyful.   It’s a snowman melting.  It’s a turtle swimming through the deep depths of the ocean.  It’s a hungry dog begging for food.  It’s a dinosaur’s head grabbing its next victim.  It’s a fast fairground ride.   Flowers in a field  flowers in a bunch  red, blue, yellow, pink  petals around the centre  their nectar helps bees make honey  they can grow in a bush  and brighten up your garden  their sweetness fills the air  Flowers   School helps us learn, helps us be us  Helps us be individual and make friends  I love school  you may not but I do  Have friends but also be an individual   You may not like someone like me  I still help them  care for them  and do all the other nice stuff for them   River  Twisty, bendy  Swishey, wavey, splashey  Bluer than the blue paint I found  Flowing   The sky, the sky  How beautiful the sky is.  The sun, the moon, the rain  You large and wide sky?  You show the sunset, sunrise  Birds show happiness with you.   When you said we’d be happy  I believed you  When you said you’d never leave me  I believed you   There she sat  In her room  Sobbing  Her face hidden  For it was contorted with misery  She radiated hopelessness  Her room was dark  Curtains drawn  Doors locked   While you are sleeping giant, your own bed is hidden,  She sits quietly, because it’s pretty cool,  Waiting momentarily to print your house!  He held his back down,  It has a big black eyes,  His gorgeous legs can cover his head,  He wonders why he likes it under the bed?  She loves cottage cheese and eggs,  She loves breaking more food,  When he wakes up, he is always twelve,  Throw out all the other meals,  This is usually an old bread or a mask cheese,  He easily closes the rotten objects  Finally, she goes back to her bed  So the giant sits on his head,  He reprinted the next night!   The day was dark  Nothing could we find  We forget what it was like  Not to feel pain  And sadness  Blinded by darkness  Stumbling to nowhere  The weight of a heavy heart  Slowing us down  Each breath, like breathing shattered glass   As magenta as a spiky dragon fruit.  As purple as a shiny amethyst.  As red as human blood.  As blue as the salty ocean.  As green as clinging ivy.   Once I had a dream,  It was about a dragon,  It had glitter emerald eyes  And beautiful, colourful body.   Please let me out of my cold cage at night  So I can stretch my wings  Please let me out of my cold cage at night   Black-grey clouds grow over me  A lash of lightning strikes me  The roaring thunder charges towards me  It starts to rain like someone dropped tea  I feel like I am riding on a lightning bolt  Lightning bolts are roots that try and take over the world!  It comes in different colours  It comes in magical shapes  I wonder where it comes from  It might come from the sun…  I explode…   There’s this place in school  Where poems are put up  Several of mine were there  I was like the poet laureate  Of the school  I decided to send  A few more poems  Two poems  One long  And the other longer  I wrote them down  On pieces of paper  And put them inside the box  The next day I expected  To see my poem on the board  I ran to the board  But didn’t see my poems  I was dejected  Were my poems bad?  Were my poems really that bad?  I will never ever put  A poem written  On a small sheet of paper  Inside the box  I promised myself  The next day  I just went to see  What poems had been put up  And there it was  The poems written by me!   Books are to study  Books are fun  They help us in learning  They give us knowledge to understand  And have morals.   My sister is cute, my sister is nice  She is the best sister of my life  She eats a lot, leaves a mess behind  But still she is the best sister of my life  She plays with me all the time,  SEE I TOLD YOU, she is the best sister of my life   Blood sucker   The ocean is blue  The ocean is vast  Spreads out for miles around  With rubies on the surface  And gold underneath  As blue as the sky above  As calm as the river impatient  Covering most of the Earth  Like a warm, cuddly blanket  Miles deep, below the ground  Filled with living things, lively and playful  The Sun above  As glittering rays fall on the surface   As turquoise as the summer sky.  As amber as a roaring fire.  As gold as a winning medal.  As silver as a distant glimmering snowflake.  As bronze as an Iron Age bracelet  As magenta as a delicious dragon fruit.  As scarlet as a red hot chilli.   As you sleep the monster is there, hiding right under your very own bed,  he sits there quietly, as quiet as a mouse,  waiting for a moment to raid your house!  He has prickles on his back, right down from his neck,  he has big black eyes, and a beak that can peck,  his giant furry feet can cover a head,  I wonder why he likes it under a bed?  He likes to eat cheese and eggs a lot,  he also likes to break most pots,  it’s always at twelve when he gets up,  to scoff down all of the food that’s been left out,  it’s usually stale old bread or manky cheese,  he peels all of the rotten stuff off with ease,  after he’s finished he goes off back to under your bed,  then the monster rests his head,  till the next night, when he raids again!   I took some medicine in Ibiza  To see Avicii are cool  When I roar, I feel ten years older  But I discover this thing to live in Los Angeles  I’m guiding a sporting character just to try  I’m a big fan, because I made a million Dollars  I put on my sandals   I walked on the road.  Not knowing  There was somebody behind me.  The somebody took my hand  And whipped me  On my back  “You will row the boat.  The one that would be taken to fight the Romans,”  He told me.  He pushed me into the ship.  I had become a slave.  I, with hundreds other slaves, started rowing the boat.  In a few minutes  I was as wet as a gentleman  Who was drenched in rain  Because he forgot his umbrella  The whipping on my back  Did not help me  Then we saw a ship in front of us  The Romans had the same plans as us.  They shot cannon balls from their ship  Our ship sank,  Like a wounded soldier  Falling after being stabbed.  Many slaves drowned.  I got to the surface.  I was so tired  I fell unconscious  When I woke up  I saw a man  Who was a merchant.  He taught me the tricks of the trade.  And here I am today, a rich man,  Telling you my story of success   I am on a bus  To my home  Tired  I sit down in the bus.  Remove my black shoes  And sit down on the soft seat  I look out of the window  We are going through  The city.  I want to sleep  I am on a bus  To my home  I just close my eyes  And a bus comes next  To mine  As red as blood  And as long as a limousine  We were at the traffic light  The red light as red as an apple  It’s now a green light  I am on a bus ride  To my home  We are now almost at the highway  The bus driver pays the toll  Two dollars  The bus passes the toll  And now we are on the highway  While we go through,  My eyes close.  And when they do open,  I say  I was on a bus ride  To my home   It can be used  What is better  Select in the simplest info  This is just a matter  It was launched very well  It can be used  Be hand in glove  Document format  How can you see it?

Tail of dog and skin of log,  fur of cat and eyeball of rat.  Ears of owl and grey wolves’ tails,  big blue whale and puppy dog’s tail.   Don’t do  don’t do  don’t do that!  Don’t be  don’t be  don’t be rude to the cat!   Wind blowing everywhere  leaves flying through the air  trees swaying in the wind  the wind is going for a win  against the rain and the sun  the wind wants to be number one!   A green clearing inside  Bursting with liveliness  Light through little gaps  In the leaves  Playful animals  Black, fertile soil   Some people say  That there are such things as drop bears today.  They wait in a tree,  Full of glee,  Waiting to fall on someone like me.  Then… “Plop” as the creature drops to the ground.  “Arrgh,” people shout as they flee.  As scared as a hippo, frightened as a dodo.   I will inspect every section  I will check for disinfection  Everything needs to be at a level of perfection  For be warned, only a handful out of a huge collection make it through.  Any questions? No?  Then let’s get started.  My name is Inspector Cardboard.  Everything I own is made out of cardboard  My chessboard, my blackboard, my skateboard,  (though my clipboard is made out of steel).  Many people say they adore me, but I suspect otherwise.  One person even asked me if I had a criminal record!   It is all a whirl, for a little girl.  If she would wait, she would find something great.  The treasure beyond measure!  It’s everyone’s desire  It makes them perspire!  That is – if you follow the clues and don’t get the blues!   Lucy likes licking lemony lollies out of Len’s  lovely lorries with her little teddy Lily   I love to play  with our hamster named Sherbert  I’m so very glad we did  not name him Herbert.  He’s fluffy and warm  and he loves to come play  He doesn’t mind that we wake him up  allllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll day.  He loves to eat veggies  He loves to eat fruit,  His kissable face  is so, so, SO CUTE!  He’s got little paws  that are fuzzy and pink  He loves doing magic tricks,  well… maybe? I think?  So that is for now  my favorite thing to do,  can’t wait to hear about  the rest of you, too!   The sun is a beautiful star in the sky  and, oh, I promise I won’t make you cry  The sun is glorious  The sun is gorgeous  The sun makes the best tombstone  for the people who make a song   Life is life  death is a knife  stabbing you until my school time  Then life comes and makes the chime  then saves you until death comes again  The process repeats until you gain  life and death   It’s a sad, lonely ghost in the sky.  It’s a big greedy pig on its side.  It’s a turtle swimming through the coral.  It’s a giant alien spaceship.  It’s a wolf howling to its friends.   Ducks waddle  Ducks quack  Ducks follow each other forward and back  They have feathers brown and green  They always want to be seen  Quack, quack, quack   Drones, drones fly away home  all the way back  10 miles long  Eat bananas  drink smoothies  until you are home   He made the Earth.  He made humans.  All up from the sky.  Some say he’s invisible  Others say his invincible.  It’s God – the supreme power.   hard work  hard work is hard  hard work is not fun  hard work is boring  hard work is bad  hard work hurts your soul  hard work   Easter bunnies are coming,  Easter eggs are hatching.

The owl who was called Hoo,  Found an old shoe  And took it to his nest.  The owl was very obsessed  With the laces that were threaded through.  The shoe was very smelly.  The shoe smelt like a muddy wellie!   Winter is cool  Winter isn’t there to be a fool  There’s a freezing pool  I’ve got a tool  To fix my ball  And I’ve got lots of wool   Teddies are soft  Enjoy playing with them  Dream with them  Don’t hurt them  Your friends   Cherries are red like a turkey’s head,  Cherries are sweet like sugary treats,  Cherries are fruit (not an old boot!),  But when you eat them, mind the stone,  Do you like to eat them together or alone?

The cat ran away  and the dog slept all day  on the mat that the cat was sat!   Polar bear, polar bear  As white as the snow  Polar bear, polar bear  Camouflaged in the snow  Polar bear, polar bear  Tries to get to sleep  Polar bear, polar bear  Lies awakes  Polar bear, polar bear  Is fast asleep   When you go to the seaside what do you see?  You see the sand, rock pools and creatures within.  You see starfish and crabs and seagulls above.  You see the sun beating down onto the golden, yellow sand.  You see seaweed, pebbles and seashells.  So head on down to the seaside, the seaside.   Polar bear was in the air   Cats are cute  they adventure around,  all around the farm  and on all of the land.  They usually purr  when you stroke them  and when you give them bacon!

These are the instruments  of the music man.   Happiest splashing in the muddy stream.  I had fun sharing a room with my friends.  Not enough swimming because I loved jumping in.  Drinking tea and eating biscuits at the end of the day.  Liked everything we did except observing animal poo.  Exciting obstacle course.  Amazing zip wire (but bit scary at the top.)  Playing hide and seek in the woods.   black and white  short and plump  eating bamboo  sleeping a lot  little curved ears  big black paws  small beady eyes  I am a panda   Rising up from below  Above the chest of golden glow  In the air the colours merge  Nobody ever reaches the end  Beneath the clouds of candyfloss  Over the hills and trees  With the sun shining bright – it eventually leaves   The butterfly flutters,  The butterfly flies,  The butterfly flips,  The butterfly glides.  The butterfly’s colours shine so bright,  The butterfly flies into the sky,  The butterfly lands on a flower,  The butterfly starts collecting nectar,  The butterfly flies back to its home,  The butterfly is all alone.   At school there’s lots of teachers,  There is:  Mrs Saucepan who teaches cooking,  The head teacher who is always looking,  Mr cube teaches math,  And there’s a student called Cath.   School, school, school,  Work all day,  Not much play,  Why does it have to be this way?  School, school, school,  Have to use a pencil  Don’t need to use a utensil,  Some times you have to use a stencil.  School, school, school,  You use a pen,  Have to count to ten,  Learn how to spell then.   Stinky socks,  Smell like a fox,  Never get washed,  And if you leave them on the floor,  There gonna get squashed.

Animals   It sits in the middle  Of a dense forest  Allowing animals  To quench their thirst  Giving lost travellers  A drink  Crystal clear as the sky  Reflections peep in and out  And gently, when the water is touched  A beautiful ripple forms  Growing outwards  Spreading, until it has faded  Out of sight   Mother duck  Sits alone  On a wet day,  Under a soft  Green plant.  The rain never bothered her anyway.  Mother duck  Cutely peeks  Out of  The bush,  Staring happily at me.  The rain never bothered her anyway.  Mother duck  Looks shockingly beautiful,  Like a visible dream,  Poking her head out  Of her world.  The rain never bothered her anyway.  Mother duck  Is extraordinarily soft,  Nesting snugly  Under the bush.  The rain never bothered her anyway.  The rain  Never bothered  Her anyway.   The elegant horses galloping in the waves’ crest  The sea laying big glass hands on the golden sand  Energetic dolphins dancing in the pearl white foam  The cascading waves tumbling on the beautiful beach  The sound of the rapid waves  The blast of the howling wind  The feel of the ice cold water running through your fingers  The sight of the dazzling sunset reflecting on the shimmering sea.   The watchman was snoring,  the bank was in trouble,  the robbers were pouring  money like it was rubble.  Not a word would they mumble  while keeping the cash,  for if they would stumble,  it would all fall down in a ‘craaash!’  After robbing the bank.  They drove down the street,  fifty larks in their van,  allowing themselves a treat,  served hot, straight from a pan.  They were all haggard and tired,  but it was a pity,  as the next day the watchman was fired!   What am I?  Fire breather  China lover  Castle breaker  Meat liker   Over the ocean,  Over the sea,  There lies a treasure  That’s just out of reach.   In the rain  The river flows quickly,  A race of the waters.  In the rain,  Silver liquid droplets  Sparkle on the river,  Like a whole water constellation.  In the rain,  The river glows crystal clear,  Welcoming boats of all sizes.   Here I have a new dog  We’ll always go out for a jog  But what dog should I take?  It had better be able to skate   In the fruit bowl there are  grapes and pears  Apples and a pineapple  Bananas and a water melon  An avocado and oranges   I looked in my bedroom and there I saw  12 rappers  11 tiny toys  10 pink pillows  9 clammy covers  8 black boxes  7 tiny teddies  6 squishy sausages  5 chocolate bars  4 fake flames  3 flipping figures  2 pink pants  1 lime lolly   Oh bedroom, oh bedroom you’re so messy  Oh bedroom, oh bedroom leave me a pressie  Oh bedroom, oh bedroom you’re so classy  Oh bedroom, oh bedroom you’re so sassy  Oh bedroom, oh bedroom, oh bedroom  Let me be snazzy   Lovely little lady skips through the woods  Looking at all the blossom buds  In her basket are cakes and buns  Maybe lots, but surely not tons  Trekking through the forest on a stormy day  With a map to show her the way  Tip tap the rain starts to go  Putting on a watery show  Looking for her granny’s house  Trying to be as quiet as a mouse  Eating a Sunday roast goose  There’s a wolf on the loose   The forests are green and bushy  Trees covered in fruits  Wild flowers at every edge  Growing ferociously  The mountains are steep and rocky  Jagged and uneven  Littered with animals  The river is roaring in its bed  The lake is sparkling calmly  The bright blue sky has no sign of clouds  Everything seems to be lively   As the aureate sunlight falls  on our tanned skins  and we breeze  through the plants nimbly   The trees prepare themselves  For the cold and bitter nights  Of winter that will come  Leaves go pale  Then yellow  Then fall apart  Trees bare and branched  Surrounded by leaves  Each of a different hue   When I write my stories I go on an adventure  To WW2, Unicorn Land or the Olympic Games  All my thoughts gush out  Like a flood of ink on the pages   Their feathers, both black  Sleek and shiny  They look alike  If only slightly bigger  One honest and proud  Another, dishonest  And yet, hard to tell apart  From their looks  Both look as innocent  As they look guilty  But when forced to speak  One sings like an angel  The other crows like a crow  And we know  For words have a lot of power  And there’s always a difference  And it isn’t how you are alike  But it is how you are different   Blue is my favourite colour  Why? you may ask.  It’s everywhere  In the sky,  on signs,  even my cousin’s hair is blue.  I love blue  It’s the colour of the  lovely flowing sea  Fish are blue so are  SHARKS!!!!!!!  But I love blue  How about you?   Wolves, they live in the wood  Some people think they drink blood!  They’re scary  and hairy  They come in all shapes and sizes  they give us great surprises  Do you think humans turn into werewolves?  Not me  Are you scared of werewolves?  I’m not really but they give me a fright  Werewolves, werewolves never met one  Maybe we could be friends?   I love mummy  I came out of her huge tummy  I love the delicious food that she makes  I love my mummy   I’m moving to my new house  I can’t keep control of all the butterflies  inside my tummy.  What a big house, I’m kind of amazed  Can’t wait for all the fun parties and sleepovers  I’m going to have.  I love planning what my room Is going to look like.  New house, new house  Can’t wait for you to come and see  MY NEW HOUSE!!!!!!!!!!   Snowflakes, snowflakes they fall on the ground  snowflakes everywhere, I’ve lost count  I wish it could be winter everyday  so I could run around with my friends  [some of them fall down] not me.  We love to make snowmen  When I was little we made a snowman that was 7 foot 2!!!!!  Try and catch the snowflakes I never fail  Snow flakes everywhere, they don’t make a sound   Before I truly start this poem  I would like to say a big friendly hello  To all my fellow junk food lovers  If you don’t like junk food and eat veg instead  Then I will still greet you  But with quite a lot of reluctance because  Who doesn’t like the following?   Sisters   My daddy taught me how to ride my bike  He makes delicious dinners  My daddy always told me a bed time story   I get to school by a car  But some people walk  Or you can go on a school bus,  Taxi or ride a bike  or scoot   Pooh Bear, Oh Pooh Bear, You Are Filled With Love.  Every Evening, Pooh Bear, Oh Pooh Bear,  Every Morning, Because You Are An Animal With Hope.  You Warm My Heart With Love, You Warm My Heart With Love,  Because You Are An Animal With Hope. Every Morning,  Pooh Bear, Oh Pooh Bear, Every Evening,  You Are Filled With Love. Pooh Bear, Oh Pooh Bear.   Many people have  Stuffed teddy bears,  Or  Rabbits,  But I have  A stuffed elephant.  His name  Is  Ellie.   A dark dense part of Mother Earth  With dark green trees and green shades   Harry Potter, Harry Potter  See him make his spells on you.  Harry Potter, Harry Potter  See him make his spells on you.  ABRACADABRA!   Oh Ma! You wake up every morning  at the crack of dawn  to prepare a sumptuous meal for us,  to get us dressed  and send us to school.   The sun rose as the poppies grew, the day the guns fell silent  The last shot fired, the day the guns fell silent  All the tears and sorrow ended, the day the guns fell silent  The 2nd of September 1945; Winston Churchill’s finest hour  They served their country well until the day the guns fell silent   I stare into a lake  Blue and crystal clear  It shines like a diamond  As I lean down further  My reflection grows larger  And I gently touch the lake  And a new image takes place  Ruining the perfection  Of the perfect reflection  It rests on the surface  Gradually expanding  Fading away  As it disappears  It reminds me  Of a life  We start off small  Growing big  Until we fade away  From history  But choose to make a difference  If the difference enhances the image  The tiniest ripple will not waste away  For each represents a stage  In life  It will live on forever  In history  But choose to ruin the reflection  Either be forgotten  Or cease to exist   Never gonna give you up…   Every time I open a book  I go into a different land  My thoughts are blurred  My memory burned away  Like the pages I flip through  And I fall into a trance  Dazed, unable to put it down  I feel like a character  I feel their pain, their sorrow  I feel their righteousness  I sense their joyous laughter  They go past my emotions  Filling me with a strange desire  To laugh along  Warming my heart  And when my journey is over  I sigh and sit  For hours and hours  Wishing I was still there  In the different land  As a different person   Oh Roger  How did you make this website?  Oh Roger, you are a good poet.  Oh Roger, do you like my poems?  Oh Roger, what was I going to say?  Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo   Best friends are forever, boys, whatever  We stick like glue forever  We laugh together forever  We cry together  We STAY BFFs FOREVER!!!!   Verbal abuse when they torment you by words,  Physical abuse is when you mind blanks out and blurs,  Psychological abuse this causes actions like mental anguish,  Child abuse when kids our age, younger and older we must banish,  Everyone who’s affected turns either black or blue ,  Please help out, there’s loads of clues   I walk on a road  of isolation.  It felt like I was cooked  alive. The time ticks  as I rot.   My sister is so pretty,  even though she’s not a star in the city,  she is a star in my eyes  but may also tell cheeky lies.  I love my sister,  she does not need a Mister,  she is my young beautiful smart sister  We have memories like gymnastics  when I twist her.  She has been through loads,  even when she wants to make me explode.  Check ups, checkups  everyday after this we do ballet.  Guess what?  I love my sister a lot.   Some are small,  some you can find on your wall,  some are scary  some are hairy  some eat leaves.  There are some  who are people’s pet peeves.  Some have eight legs,  some lay eggs.  Can you ever guess, it’s insects  To make them happy, eat some cress.   Suicide,  everything builds up on your mind.  You can’t live any more,  you feel like no one cares  so you go to the store.  You grab, of course, the sharpest thing there,  you don’t know what you’re doing  that’s when you stare.  Stare at your reflection  in the shiny metal blade,  and think about your family,  then you stayed.   You shine high above the clouds  You glitter in the coat of the sky  And you hide behind the clouds  You are my guiding star  You will guide me through the dense, dark night  You will show me the way  And put me back on track  When I feel lost  For so many lives of sailors you have saved  Across the ocean and beyond  And, so many travellers look at you  For guidance  Gleaming in the sky  I know you will always be with me  And others  And when another soul so far away  Stares at you and smiles  Then you know, you have our gratitude  For you are our guiding star   Lizard’s lung   The joy of Christmas is loads of things,  but I’m only here to say a couple.  Stockings full of candy canes,  toys ,loads of things!  If you go down the stairs,  even more presents under there!  Merry Christmas, Mum and Dad will say,  very early in the morning to see what you’ve got!  After playing in the snow,  into the warm house you go.  Snow is all over you from head to toe.  Covered in it like a snowman!  Cuddle up by the fireplace with a hot chocolate.  Now that is what I call a good Christmas!!!   My vision is tinted blue  Takes force to move around  Paddling with all my might  I fear that I might drown  Remembering the moments  When I was above  I used to stare at the ocean bed  Wondering  What was below?  Underwater, where life is more  And now I am here  Marvelling  It seems so clear   Christmas Day…   A slave and beggar I may be,   Oh beautiful child  beautiful child  you look so good to me  Oh beautiful child  beautiful child   scary  friendly  scary  beasty  slowly  stripy  black  and whitey   I had a twin  who loved to win  she didn’t like her hair  and didn’t care   Kind  Impatient  Ticklish  Tough  Encouragable  Nice   Sparkly  Twinkly  Atmospheric  Romantic   Once I woke up  I was in a white land!  I call it the number 1 snowflake.  I called my mom downstairs  Mooooooooom! Can I build a snowman?  She came upstairs with a 2 hats, 2 scarves and 2 sets of cloves!  It was amazing!   Glory hallelujah sing God’s praises  Glory hallelujah sing God’s praises  Hill in Bethlehem a heavenly baby  Lies in the hay you should join  The three wise men and hurry to see  Him without delay you’ve never seen  Anything like it, you will always remember  This day the glory of God is amongst us  His stable, his very first home  The glory of God is upon us, the stable his  Very first throne  Glory hallelujah, sing God’s praises  Glory hallelujah, peace on earth  All God’s promises through out the ages  Come together in the Saviour’s birth   Life is just like chocolate,  Sometimes it’s sweet,  And sometimes it’s bleak,  But you need to remember,  You should be grateful,  And make your life tasteful.  If life is like a box of chocolates  You don’t know what you’re going to get,  Yet…   I stare at white  And I feel empty  Like a whitewashed wall  Clean and fresh  I can start again  I feel at peace  Like somebody  Starting a new life  I sigh  And I stare at white again  Calmness washes through me  My hand rests against me  It’s just like  I have started anew   Look at the day shining bright,  Just look at the Northern lights,  What a beautiful sight,  Let’s go outside.   May is the month when I celebrate,  while fishermen are fishing  with their fish-foody bait.  I celebrate happily with balloons in the air,  while l party on,  my mother takes care.  The party turns out with bubbles and food,  everyone’s happy,  no one’s in a mood.  May, I love the month of May  when I dance and hop and skip and play.  The party ends with friends going home,  I open a Coke full of frothy foam.  I bang my head on the hard, hard wall,  my eyes stream out wet, salty drool.  I go to bed with the tunes of birds in my ears,  they wash away my tears and fears.   Christmas is close  14 days till it comes  and it’s freezing  But here in Florida  it is 40 degrees  but, I’m still  happy!   Unicorns are lovely.  Unicorns can fly.  Unicorns are beautiful.  Unicorns are fluffy.  Unicorns have pixie dust.  Unicorns are magical.   A book called It i have just read  its about a boy whose mum wished him dead  she treated him cruel and gave him no food  she hit him and shouted with words very rude  He was locked in the coalshed and had to sleep  he got very cold and his life was very tough him but  his dad tried to help him but he was weak  with a wife like that he was frightened to speak  The boy went to school with his clothes all torn  his body all bruised, he wished he’d never been born  His mum never called him by his name IT!  She shouted, Get the coal, and in he came.   Winter is dull and very cold  The birds all sing after giving birth,  The sun comes out and warms the earth.  The bulbs pop out with their heads held high,  Their colours so bright, look up to the sky  The blossom on the trees is pretty and pink,  The frog on the lily pad begins to wink.  Blue dragonflies hover over the pond  As the lambs jump about in the fields beyond .  The children all love it and are full of beans  This is spring and what it means   Christmas is a day  To spend with your family  The ground is white and chilly  The air all cold and breezy  The sky all a flurry of snow  Christmas is a wonderful day   You’re happy that you’re on the train  As you don’t want to be in the rain  But when you hear the train go  choo, choo   You feel like your going to have the flu’  You go through the mood  Where you want to eat some food  Then you come to your stop  On your way home you see a takeaway shop.   I made myself a snowball…   Are they bugs that come from Mars  Or elephants from the sun  Are they really Kangaroos  Or just a giant bun?   I think about Christmas, prizes and presents.  I think about Easter eggs and more.  I think about everything.  I even think about puppies, cats and bunnies.  I think about my family Mummy, Daddy, Jessica, Cassie, Me and Bethany.  I even think about Love, Peace and Beauty.  I think about Britan’s got talent Simon, David, Amanda and Alesha.  I think I’ve told you everything now.   Perhaps you have wondered how predictable machines  like computers can generate randomness.  In reality, most random numbers  used in computer programs are pseudo-random,  which means they are generated in a predictable fashion  using a mathematical formula.  This is fine for many purposes,  but it may not be random  in the way you expect  if you’re used to dice rolls and lottery drawings.   I go to a pond  A beautiful sight it is  The reflection of the moon  Half hiding  Behind the clouds  Resting on its surface  With the slightest of rain  Pattering on the ripples  They expand  And disappear  On a lily pad  Sits a slimy frog  It is unlike the beauty around it  It eyes its prey  A small fly fleeting about  It gets too close  In a blink of an eye  It is gone  Satisfied  The frog rests on its pad  Its ears quirk up  As it sits straight again  A snake behind  Hissing  Spitting poison from its fangs  And the frog’s throat swells up  As it lets out a shriek  A high pitched voice  The snake startled,  Stares at it  Its ice blue eyes  In confusion  Other frogs come to the surface  Hearing its call  Overwhelmed,  The snake turns around  As the colony  Descends back in  The silent water  And with that I learn  You don’t need beauty to have friends  It is friends you need  To have beauty in your soul   Where do they go?  Spain, Russia, America  Nobody knows   The teachers are…   At the farm  There are lots of things  Stables  Houses  And barns  But what lives there?  Pigs  Cows  And horses  At the farm   We wait until we’re all secure, strapped in ,all safe and calm  Then after that, we’re rolling ahead, next ears all start popping  and tummies start tensing, engines speed up, then, suddenly, we’re on a roll!  Wheels noisily lift off the ground, now we’re all flying.   Amazing all  Nocturnal some  Incredible all  Marvelous all  Awesome all  Lucky some  Super all   The bench in the park was old,  Broken  And rotten.  Mr Skinner sat on it  And so did Leah’s mum  Mrs Mitchel  Dr James  And probably another 2 or 1  Oliver and Lu Lu  One day it might be you…   Bobby is   Saturday morning and it’s football time,  The line up is announced  And the match begins.   On Sunday morning,  There is a rugby match to be watched.  The teams are…  England versus Australia.   The sea is blue,  The sea is big,  One fish is stripy,  Two fishes are funny,  Three ships floating slowly,  There is no-one there.   I hear the pigs,  I hear the cockerel,  Who is the farmer?  What is the farmer called?  What other animals does he have?   Winter is the best  Here comes the magical spring  Then there is summer   love is powerful  love is strong  love is passionate  love is not wrong  love is like a flower growing  and growing  love is amazing in every  posible way  love can make your day  love is a holiday.   I look at a beagle  It stares at me  Expectantly  A playful gleam  In its eyes  Which are black  Cute and fuzzy  Looking at strangers  As if calling them  For a warm hug   There was a honk that went bonk and a tonk.   My teacher is very sneaky,   Cheetahs running across the grass,   Elves are very silly just like me, Lilly  They sit on a shelf just like an elf  They love Santa and they have a bit of banter   Santa is on his way  Nobody is upset when snow comes  Over the clouds and faraway  When snow comes children play   There was a honk   Hello there, my name is rose   Sweets are yummy   I will put in my chocolate world  Lots of chocolate hills as high as mount Fuji  A chocolate sea like any other sea  Lots of chocolate castles and villages  to represent me.   Frost is cold  Frost is a slushy in your cup  It appears cold on your tongue   Who loves Jelly  Who loves jelly  In the fridge  Wobbly but messy  I love jelly  Its many shapes and sizes  Who loves jelly  Yum yum yum mmmm  Everyone does  But why do you need to put it in the fridge and keep it cold?   Her fur is ginger  Smooth and soft like a blanket  A golden coating  Laid over it  She sits by the refrigerator  Staring at me  With golden eyes  Without a care in the world  And purrs softly  Like a gentle stream  She walks elegantly  Worthy of a lioness  Her head held high  Her ears alert  Even when she sleeps  They quirk up  By the most silent sounds  She walks swiftly  Noiselessly  Her claws sharp  Pounces on her prey  Like a true descendant  Of a lion  With agility and vigilance  And blood in her mouth  She looks at me innocently  And purrs   It runs around us,  Just like the Earth runs around the Sun.  It is as white as snow,  and with many holes.  It is the moon.  The small sphere,  which has been running around us for so many years.   Mommy what’s a planet?  Let me tell you what it is.  It’s a factory on Pluto!   Well hello, are you my friend?  My friend replies to every message I send.  Also she’s always dependable.  When someone’s mean we go around the bend.  My friend and I are always together!!!  So bye, see you soon for another poem on Poetry Zone!   TIno is my good friend   Red as a cherry  Tender as a stem  Its petals glow  They reach out high  Showing themselves  Proudly  To the world  People look at its front  ‘Lovely,’ they exclaim  And walk away  But somebody who picked up  A tiny rose plant  Will know  About its thorn  They hurt  Beauty outside  Is nothing compared  To the beauty inside   New year is a big happening in Times Square every year   Jelly is fun  Jelly is nice and cold in the fridge  Who likes jelly?  Wobbly in any sizes  Yummy in the tummy  Might have a brain freeze if too cold  Maybe our five a day and our vitamins?   Close your eyes and imagine you are riding a horse  through a tunnel of trees.  When you get to the  last tunnel you start to tingle and your horse slowly  turns into a unicorn.  You slowly turn into a rider with  magical powers and a sparkly jacket.  You find yourself in a strange world.  The riders with their unicorns  getting ready to do magic tricks.   Wouldn’t it be funny if you were a spider.  Wouldn’t it be funny if you were an octopus.  Wouldn’t it be funny if you had eight legs.   I love fireworks because fireworks are brilliantly bright,  Fireworks shine throughout the night.  Hopefully the fireworks make it to the light,  Even if fireworks pass by a kite,  They might get a bite!!!!!   You’re my friend,  Living around the bend,  I hope you are my friend,  Friends mend  Each other’s hearts.  And you’re my friend.   After fourteen long years  I come back here  Memories flood me  Familiar faces  Greet me with joy  Causing a small twinge  In my heart  As I remember the days  I spent here  With my friends  And family  Surrounded by people  Who love me  And care  I look at the dusty ceiling  And recall  How I used to hate those webs  That were spun  By spiders  Living in our ceiling  I look at the garden  Still flourishing  With flowers  Blooming  I breathe in the air  And sigh  As I realize  That this is my one and true  Home   I loved candy  It was the best  But then I loved pizza  so now my friends  what can I do?  Help me, PLEASE   A great friend  is someone that has respect,  manners  and last of all cares.  A friend,  a friend  and my friend is Tino!   So this is a poem  but it really happened  Me and my grandma went for a walk.  We went for the best Aero ever.  We felt like we had walked through half the hospital  And then the shop was shut!   The sand is so soft,  like the fluff in my loft.  The bright sun shines in kids’ eyes,  so bright kids can hardly see.   Trotting through the fields  Galloping across the land  Feet barely touching the ground  It races on  At the speed of light  As its flaming mane  Tries to keep up  Its bushy tail  Blowing ferociously  In the wind  And there it stands  Smart and tall  It looks at me  And whinnies   Oh Jesus, why is my life so easy?  Oh, why are my feet so cheesy?  Hello Mr Christmas tree, why are you so fatty?  Santa, why is your beard so chunky?  HAPPY CHRISTMAS EVERYBODY   Loneliness is a deep dangerous purple  it smells like overdue milk.  It tastes like mouldy green cheese  and looks like a tiny locked cupboard.  Loneliness is man marooned on a desert island.   I picked up a shining stone  when I got home it started to moan.  It woke me up in the night  and gave me a terrible fright.  Next day when I went to school  I dropped it in the swimming pool.  Then it turned into a man  who chased me with a pot of jam.  When you are walking all alone  DO NOT pick up a shining stone.   Camping by myself  I decide to take a walk  In the friendly woods  On a moonless night  All the trees have drooped down  All the birds asleep  Cuddled up in their little nests   Mrs Carr, Mrs Carr  why do we do maths?  Why do we do it?  Everyone knows 1 plus 1!   I had a ball  Which made me fall  In a puddle I got wet  Slipping into the net  Everyone laughed  And I had to go home and have a bath  Nice and clean  Sparkling like Mr Sheen   It shone in the sunlight  Gleaming like glitter  Resting on the leaf blade  Slowly sliding down  Falling on the ground  Another one  Took its place  The garden’s plants  Covered in them  All gleaming like silver  And shining in the Sun  The fragments of the  Thrown away water  Which purified itself  In the presence of wind  Now slide down  The blades of leaves  As new ones  Take their place   I have a baby brother  He lives with me and my mother  We play in a tent  Which is a little bit bent  But we really love each other   Mum what’s snow?  Why?  Because I’ve never seen it.   Love is about loving and hugging  but why is love here?  Love is all about kissing,  and cuddling people that are near.   Summer is the season of  Sun  pool parties  and the summer holiday   You will hear me roar  You will see me soar  I am your dream  You don’t need cream  Everyone will be scared  You won’t be dared  They will run knowing who you are  You don’t even need to drive them off with your car  You are the king of the jungle  When they look at you they will bungle  We all know you  We want to be a part of your crew  The only place you will ever see is the inside of a tiger   The majestic creature  Walked out the cave  It had golden fur  And a magnificent mane  It walked across  Pacing back and forth  Roared at the cave  Another one came  The same golden fur  She walked elegantly  Without a mane  She eyed the lion wearily  ‘I will take care of them’ she said  As the lion left  Three little cubs  Came out next  All playing  With each other  As the lioness sat  Watching them  Each were as beautiful  As their parents  With playful smiles  They tugged at each other  And a painful smile  Tugged at the lioness’ mouth  Possibly wondering  When they would grow up  And take care of themselves  She would have to see them go  While they played  The male came in  Grinning wildly  Holding a hunk of meat  Between its teeth  And the children pounced  On it  As the family sat comfortably  In their little cave  Enjoying the meal   Spring is the season of  flowers,  Easter  and adorable animals   Once I went to the zoo  and I saw a monkey being fed in bed.  My mum brought the dog,  he saw a bone and he groaned in sadness.  Dad saw a food place  and his mouth stared to drool  It made me feel cool.  Time to go home and eat dinner  with my dad and mum, too  and then time to sleep  I feel happy and I want to be  a zoo keeper when I am older .   The zoo  has loads of animals  and they’re all different   Coober Pedy the most popular place for opals  Don’t leave me now or ever  You are my home  Even though l am going to Adelaide  You will always have a place in my heart  l will miss you, dear Coober Pedy  REMEMBER ME   the sizzling of the sausages  the scraping of the chairs  the chatting of the teachers  the scrapping of the students   What’s 1+1?  Is it 2?  NO! WINDOW!  What’s 2+2?  Is it fence?  YES!   The rain is like a shower,  you can bath in it every day,  instead of bath tubs,   she is nice  she is kind  she is funny  she is silly  she is my teacher!   Let’s go to the cinema  Why?  Because I want to  no  yes  no  yes  noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!   Mum, when can we go shopping ?  Why?  Because I want popcorn!  Dad, when can we go to the cinema ?  Why ?  Because I want popcorn!   The life of Autumn is amazing  Just think  Leaves falling that I can catch  Oh look!  A little bird  The wind goes though the air  It goes cold all of a sudden  And the birds suddenly  Fly away!  Pretty leaves  All different colours  Red, orange, yellow, green  Even pinky, purple ones  Autumn is lovely  I love Autumn  I’m glad it has come again.   A black shiny bird  Circles around me  Flying with agility  And vigilance  Efficiently causing  The death of nearby flies  Then it gives a call  A cry that shakes the woods  They talk about the cuckoo’s sweet voice  But I feel  Speech is not just about  Sweetness in one’s voice  But how confidently it speaks  With clarity and certainty  A colony comes rushing towards  The swallow  All circling around me  And I feel  The swallow’s cry  Is as worthy  As the cuckoo’s song   Trees fall, big ones first  Rivers swell, banks burst  Yet to come, waters rise  Tears dwell in people’s eyes  Rescue comes, a boat or two  Young and old first in the queue  Tables float out of the door, river’s water on the floor;  Yucky mud, ‘It stinks,’ we shout  All at once the sun peeps out;  Glimmers of hope on everyone’s brow  Anxious faces stronger now  We’re alive, what does it matter  If nature’s given us a battering,  But we’ll soon forget the pain,  If we stand united when we are knocked down  We WILL stand up again.   Mommy is a funny girl  Mommy is a joyful girl  Mommy is sometimes a busy girl  Mommy is a fun girl  But mommy is always there for me!   OOOOOOPPPPPPPAAAAAA IS A LLLLLLLLOOOOOOOPPPPPPAAAAAAA!!!!!!!

When I’m older  I want to be a singer  When I’m older  I want to be happy   Sisters annoy us  Sisters say mean things  Sisters are not always fair   Being a friend  means so much  Everyone should have one   My Best Friends are amazing  They keep me going  They make me laugh  They make me happy when I’m sad   Am I going football tonight?  YES!  Is it raining a lot?  YES!  Am I playing For the under nines?  Yes!  Am I ten years old?  NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!   This baby tiger called Bobby  had a long body  This was a tiger different to the rest  Compared to others in the nest   I love football  I love dodge ball  I love basketball  I hope I am good at ballgames   Gerbils are cute  Gerbils are fun  Gerbils are small  My gerbils are great  I like gerbils   I love my family  my sister  my mum  and my dad  I could not live without them  they brighten my life  like a star  and I love them the most   Homework is so hard  but it’s easy on a computer  It’s also easy when you have pen and paper in front of you  But it’s hard when you don’t have pen and paper in front of you   I used to be pleased with simple things  I used to be happy with the smallest toys  I used to dance to every song  But I am older now   Cry babies  Cry cry cry cry!  Cry babies  Their noise sound so real!  Cry babies  If they don’t have their dummy  They will start to cry  Cry cry cry babies!   Friends are fun to have.  Together we all do the dab.  They make me laugh, they make me smile.  We all love doing the daily mile.  Tig is the game we love to play,  Always, always everyday.   My Mum is a good driver.  My Mum has to go Morrisons nearly every day.  My Mum has to do parcels.  My Mum is a good cooker.  My Mum likes to play on my play station with me.   Let’s party all night long  I hope there’s lots of songs  let’s eat food  and these songs will be viewed  let’s not get our hopes up  there will be doves   Fruit is bad.  Fruit is not tasty.

I think he is the best in Leicester City  Ooh, and I like Schmeichel!   Stay away from the T-rex, even the arms.  It might look pointless  but its head can go right by the arms.  Want to get hit by horns?  Now you’ll have to go to an angry bull.  You could do it if it’s Jurassic Park  but it’s not!  You can’t get hit by a triceratops because they’re extinct!

I crave for food  Just a bite in my mouth  I long  To savour the taste of plain rice  The tenderness of food when I eat  After facing hunger  Fills my mouth with pleasure  And I savour  Every bit of it  The sweetness on my tongue  When a bite  Satisfies me  Content and happy  I learn  You cannot feel satisfied  Without facing hunger   I look out the window  I look out to see  The green and luscious grass  Waving to me   A woman crying her broken tears  Creates the sea  And so midnight’s eyes see  The sea exhales its breath  Creating the wind  And so midnight’s eyes see  The wind dances and plays  Creating the trees  And so midnight’s eyes see  But who created midnight’s eyes?  A child who painted a picture of blue  And spilled white paint all over  And so created midnight’s eyes  A small accident was midnight’s eyes  The stars that gleam in the sky  A sky that created the beginning of time  And so midnight’s eyes rest   Winter is coming  Make sure you wrap up  Else you will have the shivers  Ask to put the heating on, but not too high  Else you will get hot  Hope you enjoy winter  Wrap up warm  (It might still be sunny)   Fifa 18 is the best game ever  but my dad, my dad he says  that it’s not the best game ever  but actually it IS  the BEST GAME EVER!

Animals are everywhere  For proof you can look here and there  It’s a world of plants, humans and animals  And in deserts are camels  Birds, animals, carnivores and many more  Hawk, bear and tiger, you can choose any  Every animal has a different voice  You compare a lion or a toad, your choice  We can have many pets you know  Like cats and dogs  But we obviously can’t have wild animals  Like elephants and foxes  Like a bird,  I’d love to fly  But we don’t have wings  But why don’t we don’t we have wings, why???  Well, I realize, without animals we can’t survive  As they all are our life  I have a blog competition today, a talent show  And you know, I’ll write where the zebras go!!!   Football is fun  Football is about tackling  Football is about scoring  Footballers have loads of injured people  Footballers get injured a lot   Gardens are a bright green  gardens are fun  gardens are fresh air  gardens are fun to play in   Mum, when’s my birthday?

KIDZANIA was a lot of fun  There we ate pizzas, burgers and bun  Every kid was roaming around  But while we were climbing we can’t see the ground!  Police, doctor pilot and all  It carried everything as it was a big mall!  Every kid was given a chance to act something there  But seriously I can’t seem to find mom, I don’t know where  I wonder they call us sir and ma’am  I suppose we are the customers so we are respected by them  This place is a dreamland of a child  I hope we see here something wild  Today I enjoyed a lot  9:30 pm OH MY GOD!  THANK YOU!   I have a pretty surrounding  With trees in front  Street lights on the side  In the evening  Moths around  It irritates a lot  And makes a pretty surround  Moon lights up the upper side  By which the sky looks bright  Stars around the sky  And makes a pretty good site  The house looks a little odd  As lizards are around the wall  I even can’t eat snacks outside  And chana in the bowl  Just one hope I need  That no mosquitos fly here and there  It really can’t be true  As mosquitos fly everywhere  Well I realize  How beautiful surrounding I have  And I can see café in the new street  Maybe there can be a chef?  THANK YOU!   Do monkeys live at the zoo?  Yes.  Do tigers live at the zoo?  Yes.  Do lions live at the zoo?  yes.  Do dogs live at the zoo?  No!   Tigers walk at darkest night,  giving the other animals a frightful fright.  When it comes the tigers rest,  looking up at the birdie’s nest.  Playing and playing the tiger cubs dance,  thinking that they’re already in France.  When they are there, the people of France  give them an enormous pear.  They go back home to their green, grassy lair,  waiting for Dad to give them a tasty share.   Football might be a hard game but it isn’t for me.

Santa gives us presents because he loves us.   You like pink and I like blue ,  Does not mean I can not play with you.  You like eyebrows and I like cheeks,  Does not mean you have to call us geeks.  You like China and I like Denmark,  Does not mean we have to keep apart.  You like poems and I like maths,  Does not mean we have to go on separate paths.   He walks with his head held low  Not wanting to be seen,  The loner of the school  No one even sees him.  Gets pushed against the playground wall  Punched and kicked,  No one even cares  Everyone talking in their own cliques   Light, light  You’re in the light.  Light, light  You’re not in the light  Lighttttttttttttttttttt   Apple’s, bananas and pears  are the best fruits ever made  Pears are rare  but apple’s are piles of rattling boxes  and bananas are like round phones   I get into my pyjamas  I get dressed in my pyjamas again  Adam gets dressed  Pyjamas, pyjamas  Dalton gets into his pyjamas  Gets dressed  Gets into his pyjamas  Not again!   I may be alone  But I am strong  I’ve stood tall  Even in the toughest of challenges  I’ve faced them  I made my own decisions  Never consulting another  And yet I stand strong  Always second  And sometimes when I look up  The first always has a friend  I have never felt lonely  Yet sometimes  I have a twinge in my heart  As if I am not complete  I don’t have anyone to share my victories  To appreciate my accomplishments  And sometimes I feel  As if my strength is not enough  And I need another  To share her strength  To pick me up  When I fall  Someone to share my fears  Sometimes even the strongest  The loneliest people  Need a shoulder  To cry upon   Mirrors are harsh  Sometimes cruel  They are hard to face  Even for the strongest  For it’s easy to point out faults  But hard to face them  You find someone you don’t like  Inside you realize  You have a resemblance  But you deny it  You know that people talk about you  Behind your back  But you deny it  For you refuse to look at a mirror  A mirror reflecting your decisions  Your faults  But I have learnt  That to defeat a mirror  You have to face it  Face your every fault  Every mistake, everything you did  They were in the past  You are a new person now  For you try to improve  Instead of blaming  Or pointing out others’  You see your own  And you face them  You face your mirror   I play on the swings  until I’ve had fun  I play on the slide  until I’ve had fun  I play at home with my brother  but what does my big brother play?  He plays football all day   Mum, when are we going to the zoo?  Mum, when are we?  Let me think.  Mum, but just tell me, mum  Mum, when is it Christmas?  Mum! When is it my birthday?  Mum, when do I go to my friend’s house?  Mum!   Mum, do you have any money?   Why?   Because I want a pizza.  Dad, do you have any money?   Why?   Because I want a pizza,  some sweeties and toys.   No!    Mum, when is it time to go on holiday?   Why?   Because I want to go on holiday on a plane.  I love planes.  Dad, when is it my birthday?   Why?   Because I want a toy plane.  Mum, when is it Christmas?   Why?   I do not have a clue.   Defending is hard  but you will get used to it   Brother, what is chocolate?  Why?  Because I don’t know.  Sister, what are sweets?  Why?  Because I don’t know.   Can we go to the zoo?   Yes.   Where do animals live?   In the zoo.   Why?   I don`t know.   Where do monkeys live?   In the zooooooo!    Cars, cars, lots of cars  Some cars are others’, some are ours.  Lamborghini, Bugatti and Audi r8  I like these cars, they are great.  Not that I’ve ridden in any of these  They look like good cars  So get me one please!   Mum, where are zebras kept at night?  I don’t know  Where do they sleep?  I don’t know  What do they eat?

Where I go rainbows will appear.  When I get back to my house I’ll be a girl again.   Mummy, when did the Stone Age start ?  I do not have a clue, ask Dad.  Okay.  Dad, when did the Stone Age start ?  It started about 300 million years ago .  Thanks Dad,  your the best Dad EEEEEVVVVVEEEEERRRRR   Don’t be afraid of me  because I’m a tall mean person  and I’ve got a big shadow.  Don’t be afraid of me  because those things are not true about me  I’m small  and I’m only a mouse.   I will put into the box  A football, a Real Madrid t-shirt,  A football, a Spain t-shirt,  A Liga football,  A Champions’ football,  A pair of CRISTIANO’s football boots.   I went to the stream  In my little rocky cave  Which was lit up blue  By crystals spreading around  Then I walked outside  ‘How are you?’ I asked  Nobody answered  The fall continued to plunge  Splashing in the rocks  The birds chattered  Some even sang  A squirrel scrabbled about  With its nut  Protectively in its arm  Muttering something  The tree blew in the wind  Waving, as if to say, Hi  The grass whistled  In the morning Sun  Which glowed merrily  Up far away  In the sky  And I breathed in  The fresh air of the woods  Untainted by the smoke  And I knew  They were doing great  Because  Silence speaks a thousand words   I wish that I could go back  In time, to reconsider my choices  And to correct my mistakes  But I am unable  And so I live my life  Regretting the decision I made  If only I had been considerate  Thought before I answered  But I didn’t  And now, I want to go back  To retrieve what was lost   Mum, when is Christmas?  Why?  Because I want presents  Dad, when is my birthday?  Why?  Because I want presents   Audience  My heart beat fast  Slowly expanding  To break apart my ribcage  Each breath was painful  Like breathing cold air  My wobbling knees  Threatened to give out  My eyesight blurred  With black spots  Somehow  I faced up  And looked at the audience  Expectant looks  Then it went like a dream  I didn’t forget a line  Though distracted  My mouth did a painful twist  As I looked at them again  After I was done  Silence  Something had gone wrong  And then the most beautiful sound  Millions clapped  I hid my face  Blushing  And went back   I see leaves falling  I hear birds chirping  I feel the dirt beneath me  I taste the crisp air  I smell the dirt and leaves  This is Fall   Max is a great friend if I’d say so  If one of us does something that’s wrong we both say no   Books are good for your brain  They help you learn  Books are smart and they don’t give you pain  So you can be smart too   Reindeer fly through the sky  They fly one by one  Santa with his belly,  with a ho ho ho!  and it’s all jolly good fun   I’m like a shadow  Hiding in corner  Unseen, by everyone around  I prefer to be silent  Like the moon, on a moonless night  Uneasy  When I get attention   There is a rumbling and a groaning  and the ground shakes  because of these giants  It is why we get earthquakes  They get blind when they see light  go near them and they will fight  so now you know that these giants are bad  Don’t go near them and I will be very glad   I’d dance all night  Like I’d never danced before  Twirling around  At an elegant ball  Dancing and prancing is what I love  So please let me dance for all and above   Here’s what to imagine in this poem  Close your eyes and think about  Climbing in a rocket ship  Putting your seatbelt on   Its leaves were brown and hardened  Its touch was hard and cold  Turned to crisp from a tender stem  A fresh green plant that now looked old   The small lit lamp  Glowed in the dark alley  Beside a gloomy street  It stood small  Humbly giving light  To passing travellers  Who didn’t even  Glance in its direction  Unaware  Of the many lives it had saved   The white dove  Gliding through the air  Beneath the shade  Of the majestic trees  The Sun behind its face  It flapped to gain altitude  It spread its wings  And soared through the forest   Remember, remember  remember the heroes  remember everyone  remember 1939 and 1945  remember the soldiers  remember you and me  remember the lost lives of the world wars   My mum is my friend,  She turns my frown upside down,  And sometimes acts like a clown.   My dog doodle,  Is crossed between  a Labrador and a Poodle,  He is a Labradoodle.   I love cake,  It’s delicious.  Chocolate cake,  sponge cake,  lemon cake,  There’s lots of different flavours,  chocolate icing,  vanilla icing,  lemon icing.  As you can see there’s lots of flavours,  But don’t eat too much you might get sick.   I wish I could fly,  up in the sky,  higher than anyone else could if they tried.   I have loads of great ideas for epic machines  Some that bloop and some that bleep  Ones that fly and ones that roll  I even have one that you can write poems on   A wish or three wouldn’t hurt  A genie once said to me  You could wish for anything  Anything beyond belief  A genie once said to me  But I wished nothing  I had my beyond belief   A friend for me when hard times come   What happened to your face?  It is stuck in a funny place  We were only making faces  Now its stuck in several places  Oh no, the wind blew  That is what happened to you  Wind blew, face stuck  Oops, what should we do?   As he prowled around day after day  Until one day he began talk  My Mrs, you do treat me well  But I’m afraid you have a funny smell   There was once an astronaut called Nelly  She was blind with one eye.  Life was very tough for Nelly.  Every week her mum Olivia  Would drive her to lessons for the blind.  She was kind even though she was blind.   Riding on a horse,  Sprinkling confetti,  Climbing a tree,  Reading a book,  Being with my friends,  I love being free!!   Today my teacher walked in like a zombie  She looked like a zombie  She talked like a zombie…  OMG MY TEACHER IS A ZOMBIE!!!   Thank you poetryzone   A pigeon’s rooftop home,  Where pigeons sing all day  And dance all night,  And the fun never ends.   Looking at these other poems  They are really fantastic  To be my favourite, I don’t know which one to pick  If you could help me that’ll be great  I really want to see what poems people create   Garbage guts  Free friend  Fuss feeder  Soft skin  Perfect pet  Fun finder   Home is where family is  Home is where you’re loved  Home is warm and cosy  Home sweet home   There once was a sailor at sea  Who said,”Hey come and party with me!”  Then the boat drowned  and everyone frowned  But they still partied under the sea   Save the unicorns  Save them from turning grey  Let them make our rainbows shine  I’ll tell you what to save them from in the next verse   The catty and the mousey  Sitting being very lousy  They wouldn’t get up one bit  Sooner than later I might have to give them a hit   Here I am sitting on the settee  I haven’t once again done any work  As I said in my previous poem  I sit here with a massive smirk   I think football turned out to be a success tonight  Worked hard and hard and that’s how I progress  I make mistakes and that’s why I get stressed   Time to wake up, it’s half past four  I don’t want to be telling you more and more!  Hurry up child, you’re wasting my time  But Mum, my clock hasn’t rang or sounded its chime.   Hello, my name is Mathilda,  But most people call me Tilly,  I absolutely love Autumn,  Although it’s so chilly.   The sea is big,  The sea is blue,  It can be dangerous,  But it is fun too.   How much wood does it use to make a shed?  How much wood does it take to make a bed?   Christmas is all I have wanted.  The stockings are my favourite colours  and even better you get toys in them.  But I forgot about the Christmas tree  What I have got?  Hmm… I’ll find out out on CHRISTMAS DAY!!   Winter is coming, hope you prepare  you might get a cold if you don’t care.  If you don’t like getting poorly look at this now  I’ll give you some tips, yes I shall.   Being a goalkeeper is hard  It’s very tough  I’m saving and saving these goals  Soon after I get a cough   so much depends upon   so much depends upon   Trees covered in winter blankets.  Spears hanging on the  wintery blanket of trees.  The floor is covered in  billions, billions, billions and billions  of winter blankets!  Houses with snow, right by the door!  Tons, tons, tons, tons  Billions, billions, billions and billions  of trees covered in winter blankets!  Trees covered in the whitest fluffiness!  Frozen spears hanging on  the cold wet trees   Mini winter cannonballs that cover the ground.  Thor’s laughter setting darkness in the sky.  Brown and white trees that block the blue frosty sky.  The winter ground reflects the sun.  White frost falls from the sky.   A northern kiss, the sky’s black cloak  And the ship of the night.  The covered trees, the covered frozen trees  Makes my heart tear in two pieces.  Crying of happiness.  A winter blanket, a bright winter blanket  Makes turquoise bubbles floating  Made of air.   I will put in the box  A shell more beautiful than the world  A golden and shiny key  A happy and colourful star   Winter white rain  falls over a frozen angel  and above the ship of night  is the northern blow and the  freezing tears  White shaped rain  and grey thunder.  The winter’s blanket  covers hardly all the  freezing frozen kingdom.  The ship of night makes this angel bright  with a fright that expands the kingdom  covered in ice  The leaves fall  like feathers from our trees  If you arrive  a northern kiss will  get you into this ice paradise.   a winter candle with a  mountain water  a sphere of gold  winter blade  plants that found snow all day  transparent water of the trees  shine on the sun   The beautiful sun melting  to the little frost man.  Northern kiss.  Winter spear.  Ship of night.  Winters blanket.  The super flowers were so amazing.  The shiny beautiful sun is burning like the stars.   Under the winter blanket is  the hard ground.  Sky’s black cloak and its ship of night  is blinding everyone  Trees are frozen and  sky’s candle is bright.   Under the winter blade  is the cold wind,  Northern kiss with  frozen wind,   King Tut  so young  when he went… kaput!  His leg broke  on a hunting trip  A gator on his walkers  he would nip! (he he!)   The wolf entered his house  And found a little mouse  He sat down to watch telly  With Doritos on his smelly belly  On the telly was a show called ‘The Wolf Got Beat’  And the winner won golden meat  So the wolf went to the ‘ The Wolf Got Beat’  And won the golden meat  Everyone thought he was cool  With his gigantic swimming pool  Now he was the best  He could finally rest   This little mammal has spikes  but it couldn’t climb your bike  It’s immune to snake venom  and that little mammal has a synonym  and that synonym is the Gardener’s Friend  But a hedgehog would be very hard to bend  or even making it a trend!  Did you know hedgehogs are illegal  in the USA  every single day!  Hedgehogs can have fruit as treats,  so maybe try feeding it melon  or even watermelon!   My head’s in the clouds  Far off this Earth  Somewhere in the universe  Is where it lurks   I LOVE summer  because the flowers come out to grow  and the sun shining on me  But it’s not summer, it’s winter  In winter you can do fun things too  You can decorate for Christmas  Also if it snows we can make a snowman  We can have a nice warm bath  The best part about winter is Christmas  I LOVE Christmas do you?,   I stand on the sand filled beach  Laid gently on the ground  The tides come racing towards me  With a splashing sound   The sky is blue  The grass is green  All day long you’ll try to freeze  Sunshine is out  The birds are out  All day long  You’ll have a lucky breeze   bottle chewer  grass chomper  tail wagger  ball chaser  ball destroyer  door barker  tail chaser  fast runner  animal lazer   meat chomper  steak chewer  prey hunter  blood sucker  fast nibbler  fast licker  fast chewer  grass chomper  tail chaser   I love baba in the whole world,  he loves me and I love him  so much. I am his friend,  and he is my friend,  our love is together forever.   Freedom, something we enjoy every day.  Freedom, so we can have our say.  Freedom, you can’t buy it or own it  but we will always have it.  Freedom, everyone should have freedom.  Black, white, Jewish, Christian,  everyone has the right to be free.  Freedom, such a wonderful thing.  We take advantage of it,  but some people have never had it.  Freedom, we should all be free  but not everyone will always have freedom.  Everyone longs to be free.   Bitter cold in the harsh nights  A howling wind blows by  The cold, pinching our skin  Making the trees shiver nearby   Hello hello beautiful  Hello hello love  Hello hello Little  Hello hello brother  Hello hello Sharon  Hello hello ladies  Hello hello men  Hello hello sister  Hello hello dear  Hello hello teddy bear  Hello hello Biggie  Thanks again for all your help  and amazing work.   As he walks along the gravel sand,  he stops and looks at his hand.  He wonders will he ever be banned?  He hopes not in this gracious land.   I can hear beautiful birds  Chirping in the willow tree  Campfires sparkling  Like red rubies  Dropping from the sky  I can see the apples dropping  From the orchard trees  I can see the different shaped  And sized leaves  Ready to drop from the tree   Leaves are colourful  Leaves are swirling  Leaves are beautiful  They are twirling!  They are green  Yellow and brown  And golden brown  And golden red  Orangey too  Birds are flying in the sky  Like leaves  Twirling around.   I can smell the fresh air  Coming from rain  Dropping down from the sky  I can hear dripping  On an Autumn day  I can feel the leaves  Falling from trees.   Autumn days  When the leaves are golden  And the sky is cloudy  The grass is shiny  And the flowers grow as fast  As Summer goes.   When I checked the clock at school, it was 11.41.  Nearly time to leave, but I did not tell everyone.  At the theatre I had a long time to wait.  Then 1.30 came and we were asked to sit down,  Front row between Jessamy and Alistair, silent, not a sound.   Finn is grateful  Finn is the best brother  Finn is kind  I love Finn   I’ll chase it across the mountains  Through streams and river bends  I’ll chase it from fields to farms  I’ll chase it till the world ends   Wisps of smoke, come rising up  As the flames on the hearth dance around  Glowing like the Sun on the horizon  As they make a sizzling sound   The Clock Master ticks with a terrible hand,  And his apprentices follow seconds behind.  The two others wait in line,  And at the chime, one of each will surely be in front,  In a tick.  And now the Master ticks and tocks,  For all he sees is his long awaited box.  And he is shipped back to the workshop, where time began.  Will he be used no more?  But life for the Master is not finished yet,  For here his time could be reset.   Animals are the best  Just put them to the test  They’ll ace the exams  Why do you think?  They are all over the brams  They are cute and fuzzy  and totally cuddly  So get a pet  And you will not regret it.   It was a sound morning in the city of Hiroshima  6th of August 1945  Children playing on the streets  Bees making honey in their hives   When you read a book   Petals on flowers  Spread around  In perfect symmetry  In a perfect round   My Little Angel is my sister.   Like some Hurricanes mostly happen in Mexico   So much depends upon tornadoes  So destructive  F1 F2 F3 F4 F5 too   So much depends upon coral reefs   So much depends upon  Just a little pond  Providing so much life  In a big world  A little stream trickling in  Where colorful fish swim all day  A deer walks by, stops to get a drink  So many lives by the pond  Living and thriving   So much depends upon   A dream can change your future  A dream can hold you tight  A dream can make you go on  A dream has failure that bites   I chatter all day long   The clouds in the sky  As white as the  Snow on the ground  Spreading like ribbons  Glowing orange  Over the horizon  As they block the Sun  A splash of colour  In the blue sky  Each drifting away  Slowly  And new ones come  And take their place   Unicorns are my favourite mystical creatures  BECAUSE  Their fur is so silky,  Their horn can be any colour,  They can grant you a wish.  I wish they were real   The silly cat ate a phone   Have you ever wondered what your teachers do?  Have you ever wondered what you parents do?  Have you ever wondered what you ever wondered what you do in your sleep?  Have you ever wondered what your brother or sister do when you are at school?  I wonder what do you do?   What should I do?  Can you give me any clue  Oh please tell me what should do?  Shall I write about a zoo?  No! I will write about my dream  I can also write about ice-cream  Well, how about my father  No, I will write about my mother  I think I will write about a tree  Shall I write I am free?  Birthday is another good clue  I can write about how the sky is blue  Why I can’t think anything  I should write something amazing  I can write about a person being sad  Or a person being glad  I can write about anything I want  Just don’t count  THANK YOU!   As if by magic the lights turn on,  As if by magic I fly through the sky,  As if by magic I can do anything,  But I can’t do magic   Green ones,   Have you ever wondered what your pets do at night?   CID  Hey guys guess what?  Today’s a CID  CHILDREN’S INDEPENDENCE DAY  That’s what I meant which is lucky for me  Tests are over today  And it’s a big relief  I feel very lucky today  That’s what I believe  Hosting a party is what I think  On this very special day  I can’t stop smiling  I say, hip hip hooray  Thinking is done today  All doubts are clear  We are free to do everything  And I am even happier  My classmates are so happy  It’s a pleasure to see them all  Some are going to their childhood places  Or some are going to the mall  CID’s the happiest event  I have ever seen  I don’t know what will happen further!  That’s the reason I am so keen!   water drops cascade  on a window clear  my mood is drowsy and sad  want to play outside  but can’t  sky is gloomy and grey  I fear maybe the next day  will be clear but for now  my mood is drowsy and sad  looking through the window  clear water drops cascade on.   You are so envious when  You see others succeed  And yet you don’t know  How bitter were its seeds   A handsome young man  With courage untold  Both brave and strong  Fierce and bold   There she stood, against the wall  Her face regal, proud and tall  Not a mistake she could bear  Being proved wrong was her greatest fear   To inspire others to follow your steps  To lead them where they want to be  To give them hope and keep them going  Showing them what they want to see   To escape the prison of restriction  And let your imagination flow  Think outside the box  And don’t let your prison grow   It’s Halloween the day  that ghosts and the ghouls come out to play.  Hmmmm, what trick shell I play?  I know I’ll paint an x on everyone’s doors  Ha ha ha perfect.  Now my costume… I know, a vampire.  Now I need to put my vampire costume on  It’s nearly 12.  Oh no…  I’ve finished. Quick, I’ve got to go.   When I wake up  My brain is full of dreams  When I wake up  I can smell coffee and cream  When I wake up  The sun is rising  When I wake up  Down the stairs I zing  When I wake up  On the table is French toast  When I wake up  I’m off to school  Now I’m at school  with my finished homework   I might not…  I don’t know…  Oh…  No, no, no.  Actually, yeah that’s good…  Yes.  Dot dot dot  No  Maybe  Ah! Forget it!  I’m done!  Mmm, That’s good!   I’m mad,  My sister is mad,  You’re mad,  My dad is mad,  My mum is mad,  Now everyone is mad!   It’s Halloween   It’s Halloween  I’m going trick or treating  It’s Halloween  I’m going to run the streets  It’s Halloween  It’s Halloween  It’s Halloween  We’re going to knick knock,  throw eggs and spray silly string  and run away  It’s Halloween  I’m going trick or treating  It’s Halloween  I’m going to run the streets  Because it’s HALLOWEEN   I work like this,  Chat chat chat,  Ooh you do.   The school has lots of new children  The children is funny  and happy  They play with me  and my new friends.   Rainbows shine like the sunset  Rainbows are magical  Rainbows are colourful  Rainbows are pretty  So are YOU!!!   Sisters are more than friends.  Incredible relationship.  Sisters are more than BEST friends.  Treating each other with lots of love.  Everything is shared with one another.  Rare fights with each other. We are  Sisters, more than friends, more than family.   Among the snowy mountains…   My friends are funny,  My friends are kind,  My friends are happy,  My friends are always close by,  But no matter were my friends are,  We’ll always be together ,  Always.  I love my friends   I went to the zoo  to see a piranha  then I saw a llama  and fed it a piranha   I can’t get to sleep I’m so excited…   Winter is soooooooooooooooooooo much fun,  You can start thinking about Christmas and you can wear woolly jumpers,  I love getting a Christmas tree with lots of different decorations,  But at the start of winter I think about all of the things  that I have done in the summer holidays.  Spending time with my friends and family,  Going in the pool,  Also sunbathing.  I’m so sad that summer is over,  But I am looking forward to Christmas!!!!!!!!!!   Aliens are slimy,  Aliens are squishy,  Aliens are greeeeen!  Aliens are weird,  Aliens are like jelly,  Aliens live on Mars   I have this little teddy  I hug him every night,  but when I woke up he was gone  I grew up with him  and I thought he would last forever,  week after week  I was looking for him  but I never found him,  I had tears in my eyes.   Everyone has got a power  Girls, boys, everyone.  I’ve got a power, not quite a super power  Should I tell you?  It’s writing poems  I told you it’s not a proper super power  but it’s a super power.  I have to go now  It’s my bed time  See you later  Bye!   I LOVE summer  the warm sun as it shines on me   I play like a girl,  I run like a girl,  I learn like a girl,  I have girl power!   Oh no,  My sister fell down the stairs,  Call the ambulance.  Oh no,  My mum broke her toe,  Call the ambulance.  Oh no,  My dad fell off the trampoline,  Call the ambulance.  Now it’s just me and my brother,  Suddenly,  He pushes me out of the window,  “Oh no”, he says,  “Call the ambulance!”  Then he broke his foot,  Oh no,  Call the ambulance,  Now there’s nobody left in the house!   It is time for the spooky time of year  Yes, you know it.  It is… Halloween!  I am scared  Oh no  I have to go trick or treating   I wish people didn’t dress up  in such scary costumes  because it gives me a fright   I LOVE my friends and they love me  I think anyway  They say funny jokes  and I’m invited to my friends’ parties  We play fun games like funny bear  I know it doesn’t make sense anyway,  I’ve got so many friends  My best friend is called Caitlin  but for now See you some time!   Cats and mice  are enemies and they get into fights.   When it is summer,  I lie in bed with short and a vest,  I go downstairs and make myself  some some scrambled eggs  In the summer  I go to the park and eat an ice cream   You can have fun in all sorts of ways  like ice skating,  playing with your friends,  listing your jokes,  eating chocolate,  watching your favourite programs,  dancing,  singing  and the most important thing is  spending time with your family   I once had a pony it was brown,  BUT… one day It drank a magic potion,  there were gushes of smoke,  in the next minute,  it had a horn,  and a tail,  and a shimmering body.   I LOVE love food  I like chicken and turkey,  and puddings  Don’t get me started on puddings  I like chocolate and ice cream  also CAKE!!!  I LOVE pink food  like strawberries  and yellow food  like custard  I LLLLLLLLLOVE food  I love every single food but ham  But I like sausages  Do you?   I was sleeping one night  when I had a funny dream  I was in the Stone Age  Suddenly I could see a man  He was dirty and had leatherer boots  the colour of beige.  He was saying weird words like blablabla  Very quickly people were rushing everywhere  saying mammoth mammoth  Eventually spears were being thrown  at a huge woolly mammoth  Soon it was dead  That night they had a party  and ate the mammoth  I wonder if it was nice?  Soon a flash of light hit me  It was spinning me round and round  Almost in seconds I was home.   I want to be a superhero.   wing  fly high  as liberty  has begun   Mylo the cat is a pest  Mylo the cat is cute  Mylo the cat is greedy  Mylo the cat is funny  Mylo the cat is a scardy cat  Mylo the cat is my brother  Mylo the cat is my best friend  Mylo the cat is my cat   Unicorns and cats don’t mix ,  even though they are like kicks,  so I ask you  imagine a cat with a horn  or a unicorn with whiskers  That’s why  unicorns and cats don’t mix.   a red coat  a soft body  an animal eater  a bad smell  a fast runner   best friends, best friends  some you can trust but some you can doubt  never trust a stranger  but trust your friends  because the will always have faith in you.   Halloween is finally here  Bringing spooks galore  It also brought pumpkins and such  And costumes from the store   It speeds up, like the winds  The waters, crystal clear  Never stable, crooked and tricky  Boulder to boulder it steers   Let’s be happy and play  Right on children’s day   I glanced out the window  On a clear, rippling night  Pitch black, nothing could I see  Not a single home in sight   The future is something  You can never shed light upon  And when you argue that you do  The future is already gone   Not a whisper or a rustle,  Not a twit or a twoo,  Not a snore not a meow,  Not even a squeak  From the mouse  In our house.   zebras are black  zebras are white  zebras run around  they sometimes are shy  they sometimes are not   roger stevens  roger stevens  thank you for our poem  roger stevens  roger stevens  we are very glad  roger stevens  roger stevens  you are the best poet   The Calmest Place in Mexico   This day peaceful, calm.  Powerful water streams over the rocks as big as boulders,  Water as cold as ice, comes to the earth.  The moon is gone.  Small black moles hurry home.  Cactus as sharp as razor blades, rocks as hard as the Hulk.  Red and white birds rush about,  All the lovely birds begin their song because nature brings happiness.  The shooting star shoots over the sky like a plane in the air.  There’s a path to heaven over the water.  Happiness of fiesta day has arrived in the joy of life.  A new sun brings light, to all who live together here.   I have a dream ,   Dark is rising, light is fading,  Dark is growing, light is dying.   I met a little frog  and said, How do you do?  My name is Hopper  is that your name too?  He croaked, My name is Leaper  that’s what I do all day.  But when I tried to pick him up  Leaper leapt away   Roses are red  Alberts green  Violets are purple  Let’s show our love for him   All about me, I love being me  I love to have a laugh  but some times I get sad  that makes me cry  I love my Friends  who help me a lot   My baby brother woke up so early…   As Summer turns to Autumn,  It’s Harvest time again.  Crops need picking quickly,  Before the Winter rain.   Rubik’s cube might be frustrating,  Or even irritating  Yes! But, don’t ever give up!  Keep trying, till you don’t succeed  Different colors on different tiles,  Every bit, a part of me  Expressing my moods and emotions  I am as angry as red,  As calm as blue,  as playful as yellow,  as peaceful as white,  Keep trying, till you don’t succeed  For, life is a Rubik’s cube,  Reds, blues, greens, yellows  We lack the red of determination  But, we will find it  The red, red tile  Missing   It’s a Freezing Christmas night…   Last night I had weird dream  but when I woke I was covered in GREEN!  I wondered what was wrong  but when my mum came in  she screamed but did a little giggle  but it seemed very weird  I was an alien  I totally freaked out  Then my mum put me in the car  and I was questioned why?  But then the cars wheels went upside down  and flames came out  then the car was flying  and I went into space  My mum dropped me off on Mars  Somehow I could breathe in space  Then some aliens with laser blasters  shot at me  and I could barely avoid them then  I fell off the planet back to Earth  The town look deserted  then I looked around I saw one person  I think it was my dad  and when I touched him  everybody came out from hiding  and shouted APRIL FOOL!!!!!!!   Intent on destruction,  The fire, angry and relentless  Raging on with fury  Furious, and reckless   He created us, from the endless chasm  He made the crops grow, smooth on the ground  He made the clear blue water, on the beach  And the cuckoo, with its beautiful sound   The Sun shone above the horizon  In a beautiful and gorgeous hue  The sky was a kind of dark orange  Rather than the usual blue   Zooming down the road  Arriving at the airport  With our heavy load   One winter morning  when the sun shone on my face  I Heard my brother shouting Yes  One winter morning  Dad saw a bud  and called him up   The warmth in my skin  The heat on my face  Humidity in the air  The sweat after a race   Lies can sweeten the truth  Creation cannot be without destruction  Love cannot be without jealousy  Death is a stage of life  There can be no light without darkness  Those who haven’t experienced grief, haven’t had a taste of joy  To be angry is simply to be hurt or upset  Strength cannot be without difficulties  But the thing nobody can forgive is spite   I wish I had a unicorn,   <strong>W</strong>ar for the ages, war for the worlds   I wish I had a horse but mom said no  I really, so really wish I had one  I saw Kate and Millie, Hannah and Dylan  All four of my friends had one  But not me  So I laid down crying   My friends are my friends  No one can break us up  We will always be friends  But most importantly we will be best friends  Don’t believe me just come and see,  How good friends we are indeed  I could be friends with anyone  But they have got to ask me first  Bye, my friends are waiting for me!!!!!!   Fat cats  Slim cats  Jumping on the roof cats.  Fast cats  Slow cats  Jumping on the bed cats.  Big cats  Small cats  Eating in the shop cats.  Clever cats  Dumb cats  Feeding the baby cats.  Cookie cats  Donuts cats  These are my favourite cats   My name is… well I have many names  but I call myself mostly Kraken.  I live in the deep sea  I am green and a little yellow  Everyone thinks I’m scary  but when they get to know me  they think I’m quite friendly.  I saw the first shark, the first green octopus  and heard the first whale screech.  I know how many animals live in the sea  I know when the ocean started  I also know when the first flowers  grew in the ocean  I can sing a rhyme that no other animal can.  I am the fastest animal,  the cleverest  and I’m a billion years old.  My name?  Well, I have many names  but I mostly call myself Kraken!  I am the Kraken!   Sad spider, scary spider  Super, super, hairy spider   Oceans give you a lovely place to be  Happy days come to be,  Happy days come to you and me,  Reflection you can see, for you and me,  Lovely days you will see by the sea   The trees are ablaze!  The trees are ablaze!  Who is responsible for  this burning blaze?   Gaiant snakes  Chocolate shakes  Lemons pops  Mini robots  Everything crazy   Big boats, little boats,  Boats all shapes and sizes.  Bright boats, dull boats,  Boats with big suprises.  Thick boats, thin boats,  Boats with big sails.  I like every boat,  As long as I get mail!   Lurking throughout the forest  As I stride on through,  Monkeys swinging from tree to tree  Climbing up vines I see.   Why is a telly smelly   In Friendly Frank’s Friendly Farm you  will find…   Pokémon rule   Can someone help me please   My dad  He is not bad  And he is a good lad  But sometimes it is sad  When he is not glad  He can be rad sometimes too  But I have to admit  this poem isn’t true!   My mother told me to get some bread,  here is what I got instead.  Some yummy gummy bears, mmm look at that chocolate deer,  some cheesey Doritos with some healthy burritos,  some strawberry lollipops and a doughnut for the cops.  When my mother needs things from the store  She never sends me anymore   Here’s a colour,  There’s a colour,  Red and Orange and Yellow and Green and Blue  You never know when you’re going to see a colour  You’re a colour,  I am a colour,  Everyone is a colour!   The waves curl like caves on the sandy beach  and twist like the mighty mist. Under the sea  the fish swim, the fisherman come to collect them in.   The beach is really bright when the sun makes it light.  Boats are coming and going back, sailing on the wavy track.  A fisherman is fishing by the sea, drinking a large ice cold tea.   Amazon explorer  Mansion inhabiter  Future traveller  Cancer curer  Blue whale swimmer  Diamond creator.   Here’s a colour,  There’s a colour,  Red and Orange and Yellow and Green and Blue  You never know when you’re going to see a colour  You’re a colour,  I am a colour,  Everyone is a colour!   The ol’ sea is blue,   Its me from Westwood   Omitrex buider  YouTube filmer  Eating competition judge  Vet’s side kick  Teleporter constructor  Science exploder  Portal discoverer.   There was a girl from Spain  Who always was a pain  She thought she was cool  At school  Because she always would break the rules   Words come &amp;  words go  rather like  an overflow.  My brain’s a bursting  with this  and that  spilling over on the page!  Words of birds  of castles  or even  dragon  rage!  Filling  every  single  page  with letter  and word  and many a phrase.   Tuck me in tight,  right between the covers.  Tuck me in tight,  for there I will not fright.  Tuck me in tight  deep in the sheets,  I close my eyes  and rest my feet.  For deep in the bedsheets,  I shall huddle there,  as the night goes on and come up the dawn,  I patiently wait  in a slumbering state  for the time to come  for me to wake.   When I took a walk,  near the deep blue sea.  I saw something, that  should not be.   Sweet little Sorrow,  quiet as a cat,  sneaks in through the window  and lays down on my lap.   Guinea pigs, guinea pigs  everywhere, everyday  on every chair  In their cages  pictures on pages  eating everyday  playing in May  wandering around in the forest  with a pal called Borest  eating their food  they’re definitely not rude  they’re very friendly  not at all deadly  they love straw and hay  especially in May   gummy gummy gummy  bunny bunny bunny  tummy tummy tummy   I slowly step on the boat  While my friends push me afloat  The waves crashing against against the wood  Unbalancing me as I stood  As I grab the oar I say  Look, I’m sailing away   I think my poem should be about a mime,  He will have hair the colour of lime  and he will have a pair of big red shoes.  Oh I know, his favourite animal is kangaroos.  I know this poem is gonna rock but to  some it might come as a shock.  I know mime is supposes to be just black and white,  But who cares? I’ll just end my poem  with a happy sight.   Hello  If you wanna know who my family is  Then I would guide you to read this:   Love can be nice or it can be mean,  but it also can be seen…  by kisses and laughter or tears and sorrow.  For true love will stay forever  and not just stop at tomorrow. So I say again,  love can be happiness or sadness,  for there is never a right or wrong.   When I look up in the sky I see the hot sun so high  and when I look up at night I see the cool moon very high  One day I thought, why is the sun so very hot  while the moon is so cool  Why is everyone working in the day  Why is day noise is so irritating  and at night it is so peaceful?  Then I thought, what will happen if the sun won’t be  If the sun won’t be, how can I see the beautiful sea  the nice flowers and the trees  and that’s why we need the sun to see  the beauty  If the sun won’t be  how will I see?   Trudge, trudge, walking to school  Splash, splash, water bucketing down  When something as small as my thumbnail  hopped out from the gutter,  ‘Croak, croak!’  It looked at me  Plod, plod, I crept closer,  my feet were nearly touching it,  and it didn’t hop away.  After a while it seemed extremely bored  So, my new green friend  went ‘croak, croak’ and hopped away.   I know you will be going soon, so I want you to know  I will never forget you, wherever you go  You were beautiful in every way  I wish you could’ve been here another day  One day we shall meet again.   In the dark when I’m all alone  I cry a little and think of home  Now home is nowhere near  and now all I feel is fear  I try to bottle it up inside  though it’s not an easy thing to hide  Shut people away then feel more pain  try to find some sun but there’s only rain  I just keep dreaming of that day  where all my worries will fly away   There was a girl called Mandy,  And she loved to eat candy.  She always ate sweets,  Because she didn’t like meat.   Magic slips  between the  cracks. One  day you  might step  on it.   School is dramatic,  But I would rather be in my attic.  Sports are boring  We are outside when it’s pouring.  When it’s Summertime, it’s a crime.  In spring, we hardly do anything.  At lunch, people crunch and munch.  When it’s break people smell like steak.  And rhyme it’s such a crime!   Fun fun fun  in the sun  Have water fights  in the light  but watch out for bumblebees  because they might  sting your knees   When I was one  I had just begun…   Cows, Horses, Pigs  Girls with pretty pink wigs  Cats, Parrots, Dogs  They’re all sitting on logs  Tigers, Lions, Bears  They don’t really care   What should I write a poem about?  A cow, or a pig with a snout?  No I know, a unicorn from planet rainbow,  Who’s favourite thing is cookie dough,  Who has a gorgeous rainbow mane,  And her name can be… JANE,  Yes! That’ll do,  Now I need to give this to Miss Lu.   There once was a girl named Lily,  Who was a little bit silly,  She lived in a place quite chilly,  Her Dad’s name was Billy,  Lily’s best friends name was Millie,  Her favourite plant was a swamp lily,  And that was the story about Lily Twilly.   The world is a wonderful place  Sometimes this is not always the case  Wars and killing, they have to cease  Why can’t the world live in peace?  Share all riches with everyone  Or soon this wonderful world will be gone   I believe in unicorns   The knife is here  Your time is near  Time to die  You slice the pie  Tastes so yum  Like bubblegum  I can eat it for ever  But now it’s never   I took my last breath of air  Hoping you would find me there  You searched for me in every place  But you still couldn’t see my face  You would cry all night and day  While in bed you lay  I would watch over you all day long  Hoping you would find my song  We used to watch the deers prance  But now you are too sad to even dance  I watched as you grew  As the wind gently blew  Finally you came to me  Now we sing upon a tree  We watch where we used to play  While we look down on where we used to stay  Now we sway with the breeze  As gracefully as we please   The sky is dark and the  Ground is white  The world is peaceful on  This wintry night  No one around  Not a sound to be heard  Not a laugh not a car  Not even a bird  For a moment it’s just  The snow and me  I smile inside  I feel so free   Ice cream is good,  Ice cream is yum,  Ice cream is fun  For everyone.   Leaves you in your own world.   Watch the flowers grow.   Space can be cruel,  With no spacesuit you will die.  You need to have food,  But you hit an asteroid,  Your body is lost in space,  You will never see light again.   There once was a unicorn…   F – Fragile as a piece of glass  R – Remedy for when you’re feeling blue  I – Idyllic as a new born  E – Efficient in making smiles  N – Not predictable but stable  D – Delightful as the first light of the world  S – Shimmers even in the darkest of times  H – Helps too many times to count  I – Irrational, goes with a flow  P – Priority number one   I have a twin, so do you  It does and copies whatever I do   Bacon is red  Bacon is rough  One strip of bacon  Is never enough   When I look up the sky  Only when it’s night  I see a glowing, silver ball  Which seems to give us light   As I look from the edge of the ocean  Glimmering golden, for it’s almost dawn  So many waves coming towards me  And yet I know, there’s a lot more going on   Beautiful sunflower  In the mist of the foggy sky  Shining so bright   My grandparents have known me for a long while,  When I see them they always make me smile,  The best thing about them is their love,  I think it’s funny when they put on a rubber glove,  Their food is bomb,  And I like it when they make a Pom Pom,  This is why I love you.   Odds are what would happen  When a bird is really flapping  He’s as fast as can be  Way better than me   Roses are red  Violets are blue…   My dog began to bark  Because he ate my lark  He had an operation  And went to the train station  He was hit by a train  And was in great pain   I will raise my hand,  I will nod my head,  I will stop my tears,  I will never leave the side of your bed,  I will stand by your side until it’s time,  And then, only then I will say goodbye.   the blue sea  the waves going swish swish  boats float in the sky   It’s raining outside  And my family is at my bedside  It’s for me to pass on  And a new life for me will dawn  So I say to you  From the me you once knew  Goodbye with all my heart  And even though we are apart  You must never let that  Get in the way of your life   I love to cook  I use a book  I make mistakes  I give food rates  I throw it at cars  When I go to bars  I give food a scrub  I take food in the tub  I’m always rude  Without my food   When I’m on the field walking to my position  I know my team only has one mission  If we win the grand final that would fine  When they took a shot he was over the line   In the sky above,  The sun’s rays beat down on me,  I feel my skin burn,  The hot sand beneath my feet,  Giving off way too much heat,  I dive into the cool waves.   Winter is cold, there is  snow tumbling from  the sky, the squirrels  gather their nuts and  the wild birds fly.  The sly scarlet fox has  it’s silk-like fur to keep  warm and the mighty  brown bear sleeps  deeply through the  storm   The speed of the wind  Racin’ towards the end  With the wind flyin’ by  Most majestic of creatures  Can’t even wait to say Hi   In the family there is  Dad, baby,  Mum and me.  Baby is one,  Dad weighs a ton.  While I’m having fun,  Mum is buttering a bun.   Elegant as a flower  Fragile as one’s life  It could break a heart  With just one strife   I like to dance  l love to prance  I can do the dab  I can do the crab  I can dance to random music  I can do the Can Can  and everyday I am shuffling  because I love to dance   Mum where have you gone?  I need you.  You are the one who taught me how to walk  I am falling, teach me again  Teach me how to walk, Mum  Get me back up  Please come back, Mum   A lovely fairyland as a sweet time of mine.  Dancing sticks, girls in fancy clothes, green as peas.  The air is so fresh.  Flying planes as soft air in my ears.  Kings holding bags.  Twinkling stars in my fairyland.  One of my friends, a red heart lands between my fingers.  My body sinking in the sandy bed.  Red hearts flying around.  Orange multicoloured air in my eyes,  A softness, coolness, and peace.   I’m sad  So, so sad  My great, great uncle is not here  Please help.   Hi, I’m a cat  I like bats  Do you see any bats?  I’m bad at rhymes  That’s because  I’m a cat   Why is the night so bright?  Because of the star’s light?  Or because the moon shines bright?  Who knows…  It might be even a helicopter catching a robber  And he has a fright!  I don’t know if he might  But mostly yes! He might  He will get a fright and shouts,  “I get a fright in the night because of the moon and the helicopter’s light”.  But surely the tonight is so bright  with all the stars shining bright!   Are you with us when I am happy?  Are you with me when I am sad?  Are you with our family when we need you the most?  Are you always with me when I am angry?  Our family always needs you?  You are my angel.   Twilight  Picky pie  Apple Jack too  My little ponies  Are my fav too  Roger McGough  Would like this too  But the secret  Is I love you   The ice cream tastes like chocolate.  The ice cream smells like the fish and chip shop next door.  The ice cream looks like caramel to me.  The ice cream feels like a cold sea.

Charlie, Charlie made his bed  Charlie, Charlie hit his head  He started to cry  Then he died  Before he and his lovely bride could wed.   There was once a boy called Fred  He liked to eat bread  He got fat  And attracted a rat  That’s the short story of Fred   I do not know anything  I do not know anything  I do not know anything  I do not know anything  I do not know anything  I do not know anything  I do not know anything  I do not know anything  I do not know anything  I do not know anything  I do not know anything  I do not know anything  I do not know anything  I do not know anything  I do not know anything  I do not know anything  I do not know anything  I do not know anything  I do not know anything  I do not know anything  I do not know anything  I do not know anything  I do not know anything  I do not know anything   There once was a wonderful star  Who thought she would go very far  Until she fell down  And looked like a clown  Then she knew she would never go far   There once was a girl called Molly  She loved to play with her dolly  She was very light  One day she got in a fight  When Holly tried to steal her lolly   We get to school at 8 o’clock  when the school bell rings in we flock  The bell then rings for morning tea  everyone leaves in a flee  Back to our classes  our teacher’s lost her glasses  When the bell rings for lunch  we all get in a great big bunch  In the afternoon we go to drama  We have to act like a lion or a llama   Cool girls think they’re pretty,  But I think it’s such a pity,  That I am not cool,  When I am in school,  Oh, I’m such a fool.   There once was a boy called Fred  He loved to sleep in his bed  But when he woke up he thought he was blind  But actually he seemed really kind  So he wanted to eat some bread   Give me a dare  I feel like a hare  beating up a bear  in the past  I wasn’t as fast  but now I am, man   There was once a man called Ben,  Who married a fine girl named Jen,  They were deeply in love,  Like a hand in a glove,  Sadly they were only ten   There was once a sad Doggy  Who was quite soggy  He was very sad  Maybe because he was bad  That poor old soggy Doggy   It’s eight’o’clock in the morning  The teachers are calling  Kids are annoyed  Teachers need to be employed  Oh, those funny loud mornings   Batman, Batman all around the city  He carries around a knife  Batman, Batman he has a kitty  The knife is used to save a life   There once was an old name called Fred,  He went out and rode on his sled,  He then met a bear,  Who gave him a scare,  And then he found himself dead.   The clear water stream  the swishing and swaying of trees  with the stinging bees .  Thorny bushes with the rustling sound  and no one around   I think I’m starting to gloat,  About my Dad’s new, shiny boat.  We went for a ride,  My sister had to decide,  To crash his new, shiny boat.   I’m Bob…  I eat corn cobs  I sat on a log  I fell in a bog  I’m poor old Bob   There once was a boy named Lane  He liked to be a pain  He fell off a chair  Because of a bear  And went to hide in a drain   There once was a girl called Kate,  Who ate her mother’s plates.  She really was crazy  But at least she wasn’t lazy.  Oh that silly girl called Kate.   There once was a boy called Troy  He was a funny boy  He likes us to play sports  And he wears very short shorts   You’ve nurtured us since we first walked.  You were there when we started to talk  We waited till from work you came,  And then we’d play our favourite game!  You brought us up like gentlemen,  From when we could first count to ten.  Our love for you shall never cease,  Although your jokes we’ll always tease   Chocolate  Vanilla  Strawberry too  All flavours of ice cream  You can like too  Happy days are  Ice cream days  When you can enjoy ice cream.   Happy teachers  Sad teachers  Crazy teachers  Mad teachers  Who cares what kind of teacher you are?  At least you can have some fun   People are tall  Some are small  Does not matter  How you are  I bet you look cool  You should be happy  Even if you are a ghoul  ☺   Smell the salt water,  White sand hot under my feet,  A gleaming pink shell.   Trees,  Swaying, growing, falling,  Tall,  Falling, growing, swaying,  Trees.   The last Christmas lights,  Clinging around like some birds,  Switches on like lightning.   a gift to keep you organized  a present to help you be clean  a gadget for the kichen  no, that would be just mean   Some people are rich,  Some people are poor,  Some people are wealthy but nothing more.  As you go outside at night ,  And see people with no light,  Maybe you’ll laugh,  Maybe you’ll cry.  But hardly anyone can be taken by surprise.  So maybe you’re rich,  Or maybe you’re poor,  Or perhaps you’re wealthy but nothing more!  As rich people stride into the night in their fancy, comfy shoes,  Perhaps they’ll see someone who needs help.  But do they help…? No they don’t!  They just stand there,  Watching,  Listening.  Rich people believe that they don’t have to help because they’re rich.  So maybe you’re rich.  Maybe you’re poor,  Maybe you’re wealthy but nothing more.   I would like to apologise,  for not being on for long,  the last time I posted was last year!  Where has time gone?   I like sunshine  I like snow  I like brown leaves when they blow  I like cookies  I like cake  I like waffles  when I wake  I like collies  I like cats  I like clowns  in funny hats  I like baseball  I like trains  I like sleeping  when it rains  I like stories at bedtime  I like poems when they rhyme   There was a girl named Katie,  She had a friend called Bettie,  They were so athletic,  They were just fantastic  They also had a friend called Jessie.   I am Rain  A girl with nothing to lose  A girl who doesn’t understand  A girl whose questions haven’t been answered   I came into class absent and mouldy,  even though a boy came in boldy,  A cookie was delicious,  everyone was funk-cious,  I came into class mouldy.   skin and bone creature howling  snarling and growling  hunting for its prey  running and jumping like an acrobat  walking in a moonlit night  fighting with others, telling them who’s boss  he is feisty  he is marvellous  he is a wolf   There was an young girl called Milly,  Who was pretty silly  She stayed home day and night,  Said, Let’s go and have a fight,  Why is that young girl called Milly.   Night  Dark quiet, peaceful  The stars are bright…  It is very bright  Sunny, bright, loud  Day   There was a teacher called Mr Morris,  He said his class was the best,  Mrs Wintor did not agree,  They got in a fight,  The kids ran off and had free time,  The teachers did not even care.   day  bright, cheerful  yelling, cheering, playing  sunny and dark  resting, sleeping, lying  dark, quiet  night   School is fun,  When work is done,  We will have our fun,  When I hear the gun,  I start to run,  When the race is done,  I RUN, RUN ,RUN,  And… that’s my fun.   There was a girl named Katie,  She had a friend called Bettie,  They were so athletic,  But could not bet it,  They also had a friend called Jessie.   From the educated high school  To our majestic rooms  The playful oval were we play tiggy  but our playground is not that biggy   The Owl and the Pussy-cat went to sea  In a beautiful pea-green boat…   Ding Dong!  went the bell  while I was playing King Kong  “Coming!” I said  As I jumped off my bed  And ran to the door.  “What? Are you sure? There is a WAR?!”  Well, there must be SOMETHING I can do  But to be honest with you  I had no clue.  And that is why  I never saved the town  From devastation and despair  But then I woke up  At six o’clock  and realised  “It was all a dream!”   Mini Man lives in a van  Sorry to say he met Jackie Chan  He walked away  and met Micheal Bay   I like potato chips  they are very yummy  I eat them all day everyday  I love potato chips   There was an young girl called Molly,  Who had a doll called Polly,  She ignored her mum,  She was pretty dumb,  But her family thought she was jolly.   I like to play sport  I always take my port  I like to build a fort  I am really short  I hope I’m not caught  I like to go to the airport   From our high school to the primary school  To the classrooms where we work  It’s big it’s roomy, it’s far to movey  Southern Cross is our school   I love to play my footy  It makes me think about putty  Because of all that running  I learnt how to do lots of drumming   the outback  is a wonderful place  it is a calm place  not really cool   The day is bright  The night is dark  The day is fun  The night is sad   I love to eat food,  Because your such a dude,  I love painting a pot,  even though dogs have spots,  I love to eat food.   There was a school far away from town  A lot of kids and parents came around  The bell went ding dong  People played King Kong  and when the school was finally found  the school was of course moved into town   There was a phantom potato,  He wished he was a tomato,  He cried and cried,  and tried to hide,  But a human came,  He found out their name,  Then he gobbled him up again   I know what happened to Lulu, mother  I know what happened to Lu,  Carefully packing her bag as she left behind a lonely shoe   There are lots of rooms,  even though they went boom,  I have lots of education,  and it also gives you inspiration,  I love the broom.   I love roses,  because they have poses,  he entered this room,  and the man’s name was Mr Bloom,  Did the man love his roses?   Roses are red  violets are blue,  Watch out – I’m staring at you  Grass is green,  Sun is yellow  Would you care if I came to say hello?,  All the colors I just said were red, blue. yellow and green  Do you want me to give you a bean?   I went to bed,  even though I was fed,  I was so tired,  But i was fired,  I want to go to bed.   I want to go to the park,  But dogs bark,  I lost my shoes,  with a couple of clues,  I want to go to the park.   There was a cat called Kitty,  Her best friend was called Nitty,  Her tail was chopped,  But she still hopped,  It wasn’t very pretty.   I haven’t been able to send poems much,  I don’t go on this website at home  instead I crunch and munch snacks all day,  I’ll try to send more soon.   Foxes are red  Foxes are quiet  Foxes don’t go on a diet  Foxes are cute  Foxes are mad  Foxes are sad  Foxes love hiding  Foxes don’t love dying  Foxes are my favorite   We get to school at 8 o’clock  when the school bell rings there is a flock  of students going to their classes  teachers losing all their glasses  when the bell rings for morning tea  everyone goes out quite orderly   I love my school,  Without the rules,  It is quite rather fine,  This lovely school of mine.  I see my friends,  And when school ends,  It isn’t rather pleasant.   There was once a old man named Bob  He loved to bike ride with his old mate, Bill  They loved to go for a ride  Every morning and afternoon.   There once lived a small boy called Bob  He loved to cry, sook and sob  Because of all that sooking  He learnt how to do lots of cooking   I love my house  Because it does not have a mouse  It has been here for about five years  Which is good but at least I will not have any tears  And that is why I love my house   There was an old man of Chile,  Who came out painful and silly,  But that old man was hungry,  And his name was Dundry,  But why was that old man from Chile?   My friends are the best  We never fall out  But just sometimes  We say the word doubt   I love my school,  even though it used to be dull,  It has lots of education,  And it even gives you inspiration,  But some kids act like a fool   There’s a bear on my chair,  and I just don’t care.  There’s a hare, my pear ,  an I want a dare,  because its giving me a scare  like a furious bear.   As I skated across the love stream  the love stream, the love stream  as I skated across the love stream  I saw the golden voles.   There was a midnight crowd,  they were really proud.  It was in the snow so I said, Ho  hit that tone on the bone.  The bone hit the crown,  and the crown went down,  and went on the sleigh,  and the sleigh went away.   There was a old man in Deal ,  Who always stood very still,  He was never hungry  And is name was Dundry,  That  funny old man in Deal.   There was an old man with a dog,  who came with a frog,  But he lost his shoes,  With a couple of clues,  Why did the man leave his dog?   I once had a koala,  He loved to swing and play.  But when I set him free,  He didn’t run away.   Dad, dad, dad  when I’m sad,  you make me glad,  I’m so happy that you’re my dad.   Betty bought a bit of butter…   My cat, my cat, my cat,  how I love you now,  how could I ever lose you?  How long will it take,  my cat, my cat, my cat,  my lovely little cat?  I can’t believe it, your  my cat,  Brownie  and your babies,  Mutu,  Cloudy,  Mishmisha  and Chichimoro  and i cant wait to see  Tuti,  she’s from another family.   No matter how I feel  I will always make a deal  I feel like there’s an earthquake  When I’m having such a heartbreak  I saw my friend’s death  When I had just run out of breath  I went to the store  when I noticed there were more  just as I heard her  I knew she was a murderer  HELP!   today is the day  this is the one  today is the day  where we learn and have fun  today we will grow  today we will be kind  today is important  don’t leave it behind  let’s give it our all  let’s never stop  we’d better get busy  before we all…  pop!   I know everybody loves the world in peace,  You know everyone has someone special either your mum or niece.  But in some parts of the world there is war,  Those people are sad to the core.  Also children and adults with a serious risk,  That we can fix.  Like people with cancer we can help them become a dancer!  Some parts of the world are hot and sunny,  But some need shelter, food and money.  Some people in the world are not as lucky as you,  They might need some help from you too!  Donate what you can today,  So they don’t get a drink from the dirty bay.  Or so their dreams come alive,  So their favourite pop star can arrive!  They will thank you more than ever!   Walking down a narrow path  Dull and dark as night  Junk and litter, scattered about  Not a single soul insight   Chocolate, Chocolate  Who said I don’t like chocolate?  Chocolate’s the best  It’s better than the rest  Who said I don’t like chocolate?   It lives in a perfect pupa doodle paw park.   My beautiful friend  You’re a superstar  You’re fun, kind and reliable  But that’s not all you are   Wendy is beautiful,  Wendy is a whale.  Wendy was sad,  Wendy broke her tail.   Myaliz, Arianna, Yamilete, Caren and KK  There just one thing I would like to say  It’s lovely having friends, there is no doubt  And it’s never fun when friends fall out  But I should remind you, rather than chatter  How about some different subject matter  The Poetry Zone’s for poems, which I think is exciting  Let’s see what you can do. Let’s get writing.   Colours are nice  Colours are more than thrice  Red, orange, yellow  Don’t play a cello  Green, blue, purple  Don’t do a burple   Khamren and Juel  we are best friend.  But we need to talk.  What team you going for?  Cavs or Golden State Wareers .  I pick Cavs and me to Khamren .  We are best friends.

Foxes are red  Foxes are quite  Foxes don’t go on a diet  Foxes are cute  Foxes are mad  Foxes are sad  Foxes love hiding  Foxes don’t love dying  Foxes are my favorite   Don’t mess with us we are true friends  and true friends is not a joke  Yea, they might not like me  but I don’t care because  I have other friends like Arianna and  Caren   Were all best friends till the end.  I have a pencil that bends!  I let my best friends use my bendy pencil.  We have smencils.  We’ll never ever tell each other’s our secrets!  I trust my best friends to not be snitches!   I was living a life  and I was having so much fun  my life is settled  and I was eating a bun  I was racing to win  but some guy threw me into a bin  That guy kidnapped me  and told me to make a missile  or I would die  I am a rich guy  but he pretended to occupy  I made a robot out of steel  that made that guy kneel   Friendship matters in true friends.  The 3 of us are best friends!  We have fun all the time.  We watch the Jungle Book all the time!  We have pet stuffed animals and take care of them!  We are true friends and have true friendship inside of us!   Friends are always there  when you need them  Friends are fun to have around  but sometimes you have to be  careful with who is your friend  because they  can always just  up and leave.   It was just another day in Liverpool  until the vet came knocking  My heart was beating like a drum  and my whole body was rocking.  I hid behind the sofa, hoping I wouldn’t be seen  But she was too intelligent  I hoped she wasn’t mean  She grabbed me by the collar  Looked at me in surprise  Then got out her tweezers  And looked at me cross-eyed  I prayed for a miracle  And my thoughts went pell mell  “Pluck!” she pulled out a splinter  And all was well   My friend is a peopleian.  Peopleians have a Pepsi business.  There favorite food is potatoes.  Their favorite color is purple.   One way or another and I’m gonna getcha getcha!  I will drive past your house.  And if all the lights are out  I will see who’s around.  One way or another I’m gonna meet ya meet ya!   Hi, I’m Yamilete  My bestfriend is Caren  I love you Carebear   I can see the planet mars  While I eat some chocolate bars ,  Up there is the blazing sun,  don’t look at it,  it won’t be fun.   pizza is greasy  It has delicious toppings  greasy, greasy… BITE   I am the greatest apple,  There’s nothing to discuss!  Because I’m good at everything,  No need to start a fuss!  Although you have bad timing,  I just wanted to stall  Now, what’s going on?  Oh no, I’m gonna fall!   I went to the zoo to visit a llama,  and fed it a banana,  then I saw a piranha,  and then I fed it a llama.  I saw a monkey,  and it looked a bit funky,  he turned around and his bottom looked chunky.  “Hey chunky monkey, over there looking funky,  how about you come with me  and will do something homey hunky monkey.”   Caren is nine  She is my best friend  I love her  She’s always there for me  If we ever split I wish to meet her again.

No ice, just the warmth in the air.  Going on walks in the late evening sun.   Spring is the time of year  Everybody deserves a cheer  Let’s open a bottle of ginger beer  Because spring is here!   My Mummy is the best,  She likes to have a rest,  She snores a lot that’s why,  She is the diamond in the sky,  She likes to sit in a trance,  then you think that you can dance.   Kidding  Identical  Dramatic  Slide  Pots and pans  Love  Always  Yay   Teachers are happy  some of the time  They sometimes eat a lime  they do not like slime  They really love home time   The little little poem  on your own  playing and waiting.   This website is good  I like this website  This is a terrible poem  But this is a good website   Gus the giddy goose gets loose  he hops into a blue caboose  it zigzags swiftly to the zoo  with Vi and Bud and Queenie too  Along the way they play six tunes  on instruments and sets of spoons  with honks and trumps  Gus and his band  play crazy jazz  across the land   is it a cat?  no it is a bat  a cat  no a rat  is it a cat?  no, it is a mat  a cat?  no, a hat  is it a hat?  yes, it is a cat  it is Cass   Sass is fast  Sass is a hit  Sass has a cast  Sass has to sit  If Sass sits  Sass is stiff  Tiff, tiff, tiff  Sass has a fit  Hissssssssss!   Jack likes to trick a bat  he makes her act  just like a cat  he runs around  inside the house  to chase and pester  Mars the mouse  she paws at balls of yarn and string  just like a cat  but with her wing  but when her bedtime came Jack found  that kitty cat was upside down!   My tooth fell out my mouth  And left an weird, open space  So it’d make me look sketchy  When there’s a smile on my face  And I get teased whenever I open my mouth  I don’t even know where to begin  I can’t laugh openly  Or smile or even grin  I certainly do miss that little tooth  But there’s one benefit as you can guess  Whenever I brush my teeth  Now, I have to brush one less   comedy   Hooray, today’s the day! I play away. I have a friend.  He has a big fat red hen and we will play till we sleep  Weepers jeepers, what a sleeper! I went home with a tantrum   The London Eye  Gazes –  While twirling round slowly,  over the Thames.   Westminster Abbey  beams: so proud.  Its white bricks, loud,  glowing in the night.   Ant  Newt  Iguana  Monkey  Ant-eater  Leopard  Snake   The canal sits  Calmly waiting  For dawn to break.   The London Eye  It twists and turns  Throughout the day and night.   The London Eye,  Stands tall,  Scanning the city,  Watching-waiting.   Westminster Abbey,  awaits to inhale more  politics   Life is boring  Rockets are soaring  Rain is pouring  Lawn mowers are nnnnnnooorrrriiiiinnnggg  Life is boring   Keep  Intelligent  Domestic  Silent  Played  Love  Avocado  Yay   Aliens are green,  They are mean.  Four eyes they own,  I think they’re sewn.   The twinkle of the eye  A spark of energy  Shimmers dazzlingly  Never to die.   The London Eye,  giving an enjoyable experience  to all of its audience,  providing a pleasant ride.   The London Eye  illuminates the sky  filling it with bright colours   St. Michael’s Mead  a Mead with heart,  waiting to help people  make a new start.   Zebras are black and white,  owls are always right.  Giraffes are tall,  mice are small.  Cheetahs are fast,  hippos come last  Elephants are big,  a stick animal looks like a twig.  That’s what I know about animals.  Oh… and camels have humps  that look like massive bumps.  That’s all I know about animals.   Green leaves shadows dance  Sunshine blinds curious eyes  Dripping popsicle   The London Eye  Scours the darkness  Like a guard.   The London Eye  Keeps watch over London,  gleaming like a star  to the whole of the city.   Big Ben  gracefully sings  to the River Thames.   The London Eye  Dancing in the moonlight  Acting as a security camera  Over the Thames.   Big Ben,  Singing over the houses  Of parliament.   The Millennium Wheel  twirls over  the audience  of the city.   Dad’s the hero,  He is never number zero,  He saves our world by working hard,  He is always by our side like a life guard,  He buys us toys and clothes,  No matter where it’s on the globe,  We are his priority,  But he shows his authority,  And dad’s rule,  But he is not cruel.  He may not be a mind reader,  But he surely is leader,  So remember…  Dad’s are not zeros  They are our Heroes.   Who can I love?  Loving is tough  I feel lonely and no one has told me.  I like other people but they don’t like me  so just tell me why, please  I just want to have a friend  That’s the end.  Thanks.   Kittens  they are fluffy,  cute and funny  Sometimes, that is!  Dogs  they listen to what you tell them  Sometimes, that is!  Hamsters  they eat all day  and sleep all day  Sometimes, that is!  Fish  they swim all day  Sometimes, that is!  Bunnies  They hop around all day  Sometimes, that is  Not if they’re sleeping.   Deep in a cave there is a big brown bear  There’s a big fat cat in the window  There’s a tiny little frog jumping on a lily pad  There’s a sausage dog eating a sausage  A zebra with a girlfriend, hanging out  There’s a Dinosaur eating grass with his nose sticking out.   The green leaves  The sweet breeze, so lovely and beautiful.  The swaying trees  The gorgeous plants, so marvellous and pretty.  The blue sky, it’s up so high  And the sun is hot and bright.  The clouds are up so high, flying in the sky.   I like the flowers,  I like the daffodils that all come out  and start to bloom  just in the SPRING.   F un  R ude  I ntelligent  E nergetic  N aughty  D etermined   A pile of puppies  A cuddle of kittens  A clump of cows  A puddle of pigs  A party of ponies   I like to tease  and chew some trees  did I mention I like pies?  I love #FOOD  I have a fire in my house  I’ve got to go – bye  Just a second I need my teddy  Time just flies when you’re having fun dumb  and that was the poem that doesn’t work   I raised my hand in class this morning,  sitting in the back…   aliens have 200 feet  aliens have 96 eyes  aliens have 26 legs  aliens eat 3000 pies   She would look good in a Harry Potter film  With her long pointy nose and colossal sticky out chin.  We play Harry Potter wizard chess  And I almost always win.   Good learners get stuck.   I love my teacher  she is the best teacher  she makes clues  she says I love you  I’m nine  And my teacher is my friend   It was a fancy dress party  With many, many things  There were vampires and Draculas  And fairies with wings   I got a bear for my birthday  My dad thought it was fun  Mom got me a kitten  She thought I’d always wanted one   The skin I’m in cannot tell my whole  It cannot tell you who I am  On the outside you will see  Brow skin, black hair, brown eyes  But that is only a small part of me   The skin I’m in is just a covering  Beauty is not skin deep  We are given labels  Black or white  We need to rip them off and think, who would I be without them?   The sun is setting  and the seagulls are soaring  over the starfish and squid.  The sky is getting dark.  Better swim away from the shark.   High school, what a misery,  I hope I can get all the help I can get,  but I’m losing my best friend summer,  and nothing will keep her here.  Trust me, I’ve tried   My boyfriend trying too open my diary,  It took him a while but he managed it,  and he looked though it.  God, did I walk away from him.  I slammed the door.  He came behind me  and hugged me sorry.  God, my boyfriend is annoying.   There was someone  Known famously as Lee  He was extremely funny  As you are to see   Spring is a season that everybody loves  as the bird flaps its wings in the sky above.  Flowers start to come out and the hedgehogs are about.  The deer stalk the hedges in the early morning mist.  The sun is shining, everybody is laying on the golden, sparkling sand,  everyone is outside playing and having fun  and as time goes by it’s soon time to say goodbye.  R for roses,  L for lily,  D for daisies,  B for bluebells,  D for daffodils and  L for leaves that are slowly appearing on the fresh green trees!   My world of gloom  where flowers never bloom  a place of grey  just grey everyday   get up and groove  but I think I can improve  let’s have a laugh  and on my behalf  have a little jig  but it might be a bit big  so get up and groove  I will play it smooth   The flower  the flower  it’s there  it is amazing  I will keep it and treasure it   Love is a gift  Don’t let go  until you’re sure  he’s not the one for you,  unless he is the one you need  and defiantly want.   Once I was in Year 6,  and now I’m at a big risk,  through the adventures I hold  in the palm of my hand,  and the further ones at my feet.   Insects are cool  Insects are small  They live in a web  They live in a hall  Some are small  Some are tall  Don’t be scared of them at all!   I love my teacher,  although she’s mad,  sometimes she cries and I feel bad.  She’s Mrs Stone the only  person who makes me feel glad   Stones are the things  we treasure  But the stone I treasure the most is  Mrs Stone   On Saturday morning, I went to Gaston Farm  For the Open Lambing Weekend.  I held two beautiful ducklings: one black; one white;  One tried to peck at my jumper stripes.  I held two extremely lovely golden chicks  All four were very delicate, soft and smooth.  I wanted to take them all home and keep them as pets.   As I happened to be passing by I noticed something different,  a brand new pier at the seaside,  it really did look empty last time I was here.   I want to make a film  I really, really do  But how am I meant to do this  With only me and you?  I’ve only got my house  And my garden to film  How am I meant to joust  When I have no horse and stick?  For the cast I have no one  Only me and you  I need a tonne of actors  To make this dream come true  How am I meant to write the script  And learn all these lines?  I want to be an actor true  but not have all these parts  How am I meant to fly  when I have no sky?  Where is the green screen  and the harness to make you go high?  I want to make a film  I really really do  but how am I meant to do this  with only me and you?  Now I give up I really do  I think I rather  Make a house  That’s what I want to do!   Today I woke up late  Thus missing my train  And making me late for work  Which I’ll never be again   Into a dog I can transform  Into a duck I can change  I can convert into things  Very, very strange   Susan Sue, the bad girl  The bully of the school  Being very, very mean  And throwing children in the pool   Candy rain  Toffees, Chocolates  Kitkats and more  Candies and candies  Knocking on your door   Coming into spring,  there goes the phone – ring, ring.  It’s time for your holiday,  do you want it on a Sunday?   Darling rose your petals shine bright,  Everywhere, dark or light.  Your brilliance brightens up my day,  So forever now, I say hurry.   There is a book  A mysterious book.  Nobody knows what it says.  It is written in an ancient tongue.  Have you discovered it?  I hope not.   Summers!!!  Summers are here  Feeling nice and warm  Having tons of birds  And a bee swarm   <strong>I</strong> once was a bump in my mummy’s tummy,  a small tiny creature, a big deal with every single feature.   Spring has sprung  parks are fun  rainbows in the sky  iris flowers shooting up  nights get lighter  green leaves on the trees   It gotta be fun,  It gotta be cool,  It gotta be like we’re in a pool!   How their coats gleam in the sunlight  Magnificent solid colours they are  The horses with the chestnut coats  Shine as reddy-gold as the sinking horizon  The foals are so cute,  Their long legs are spiders,  Wobbling as they walk  And whilst riding into the sunset,  The wind whistles a fast tune  As the stallion gallops majestically,  Into the evening bloom  Horses love sweet, sensational sugar lumps,  So scrumptious, oh yes  And when they neigh  They just want some hay  To chew while they chill.   Mind-Reader  Motor-Mouth  Hug-Giver   Poems can be funny or serious, they’re still good  One of my favourites types are silly ones  Enjoy them – I know I do  Time to time – I read poems but I always like them  Read them when you’re sad or worried  You should try   Tapping all night, dancing all day, helps me clear all the cobwebs away.   This is a lost cat  Oh, hi there. Did you know I’ve lost my cat  I have looked everywhere but have you seen him?  Yes we have. He’s behind you  No he’s not, I looked  Woo, I know – he’s dead  No! I looked in the graveyard  Oh no… I know  He’s on my head  Silly cat!   science is fun  anything can be done  from slimy gunk  to bits of junk   Fat ball of fluff  Loves a rub  Until the day is over  Face full of fluff  Fluffy is his name  You like him don’t you?   When you are on a farm be aware  Everywhere  Because you  Might hear a…moo, meow, woof,  Neigh, quack, baaaaaaa, broom broom  The farmer is coming!  Shhhhh…   Weather is different, it changes everyday  Early in the morning the sun begins to rise  After the sun has risen  The rain comes down and soaks everybody. NO, NO AND NOOO!  Hearing the roar of thunder  Everybody wants to see lightning bolts  Rain, rain, rain. “Boring”. I hear everyday sun is cool and everybody knows it!   They are small,  They are very colourful,  But they are shiny,  They are helpful,  They are peaceful,  They’re sweet,  But what if they are magic?  Look and you will see.   My cat was a fat cat  and he liked sleeping on a mat  a big mat.  He was a skinny cat and he liked playing  a day later he turned into a dog  a big fat dog  He was tired  He fell asleep  When he woke up he was a slippery seal  His hands were slippery  He fell in a hole  He was a lost seal  He fell asleep  When he woke he went in the shower  He said he’d had a long day  He fell asleep again  And turned into a human who liked footballs  He fell asleep again  Now was a sleepy cat  When he woke he was a fat cat  Then it started all over again  Again and again and again also…  it happened FOREVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   My dog has a toy,  A very loud toy,  It squeaks and squeaks and squeaks,  She rolls on a big mat  My mum yells, “Get off the mat!”  But she doesn’t listen  She never listens  But she chews on my shoes!   Fat cat  At the vets  Too fat? Or juat fat?   The secrets of the dawn of midnight is what you need to hide  Because you can hide from you’re parents so you can be a…  MILLIONAIRE, yay everyone needs money in the dawn of midnight  So you can buy everything for your XBOX, yay everyone needs an electronic for a secret  Wow you need everything I have a dog and his name is the secrets to get me MONEY yay money you  Need money you need money everything for the dawn of midnight  You need a secret to hide from the people you can see so you can play for the rest of the day yay us  Can play for the rest of the day on the secret Xbox yay we can play on the Xbox and the secret Xbox  Game yay we can play for the rest of the day woo?  What shall we do now shall we set fire to that house, no, a mansion  But where is a mansion?  Oh, in a different country.  Oh no, we’re not going there.   Bad spiteful creatures they are  Everyone who dreads them  As quick as flash they are  Slither through the dark night  Till 12 o’clock when they pounce  See you at your funeral   There is a cat  called Fluff  who loves being inside a hat  Why does he like being in a hat?  Who knows?  I don’t know, do you?   Planes are flying things.  They take people anywhere!  They could take 26 people at a time.  Some planes can drive on water.  Planes are big and white.   Pokémon is fun to play with  On the Pokémon Bus  Kick and punch Pikachu  Eat food Pikachu!!!  Munch on food Pikachu  One Pokémon for you  Now how is my Pokémon?   Let’s go and play with Lego  Exciting to play with  Great to do  Only the best Lego!   Hello, I’m Sam,  I like ham.   Goodbye snowmen.  Hello fluttering flowers.  Goodbye Father Christmas.  Hello Easter Bunny.  Goodbye bare branches.  Hello beautiful blossom.  Goodbye yummy hot chocolate.  Hello melting ice lollies.  Goodbye icicles.  Hello Easter eggs.   I have a fever  I could not cry  I was burning up  I was so hot my tears were evaporating   There are two dog called Freddie and Treacle  Treacle barks and Freddie doesn’t  Treacle steals Freddie food  but Freddie doesn’t  They chase squirrels  and they like going for walks  They are beautiful   First I’ll get into my space suit .  Next I’ll bravely wave goodbye.  Then I’ll get into my space craft.  Built to sail right through the sky.   I love you mom.  How can I tell you  That I can never be as strong  As you are?  I love you mom   Magic, how I love magic  Goblins and imps and gnomes  With terrorising monsters  In your homes   My sister really is smart  The smartest person I know  No one could possibly be more intelligent  Not a friend or foe   If I had my own world  And people did what I please  They’d probably be playing on I-phone  And eating loads of cheese   The kittens are taking over  Oh it’s a great day  No one will ever study dogs  Starting from today   Do you know why my hands are well…  Covered in ink?  Well I was doing my homework  With a pen that was pink   The volcano erupted  And the ground shook  A tornado came  Taking all my toys and books   Fish, fish, fish  scaly, scarlet, special fish  cute, cool, colorful fish  friendly, funny, family fish  Fish, fish, fish   Last night I had very sweet dream  It was filled with sweet candies and cream  It had little gingerbread men  who were wearing yummy, creamy cookies  That was the best dream ever!   Animals are cute without a doubt  Please be kind, don’t ever shout  Fluffy and cuddly they make me happy  All animals want friends be nice to them  Love animals and care for the animals  Stay with your animals and care for them   <strong>H</strong>e’s always hungry  <strong>A</strong>nd sleeping at no specific time  <strong>M</strong>ammoth-sized (not)  <strong>S</strong>lowly waddling to the wheel  <strong>T</strong>all, compared to a speck of dust  <strong>E</strong>nding the day with a squeak  <strong>R</strong>ipping up his newspaper bed   Golden, red, black, brown  All the best colours in town.  Loyal, helpful, loving and more  What could be better at all?  Soft fur, scratchy fur or even in between  Still I love my Labrador.  I throw the ball, I hear him panting, running, walking  I give him a hug and he gives my a dog kiss  Yyyuuuccckkk!!!  But whatever colour, whatever loyalty, whatever fur type  If he runs or walks, or gives me disgusting dog kisses  I love my Labrador and he’s the dog for me   He comes when the moon is full,  He skulks through the densest of woods,  He spies on the most paranoid of children,  He lurks in the darkest of corners,  He leaves no trace behind,  He snatches any witnesses to his presence,  He takes all of the joy that may hide deep inside you  and replaces it with the purest of fear,  No happiness will exist as long as he’s alive  ONLY FEAR!  He’s the Bogeyman.   Once I went on holiday  And there was a tiger where I went to play  I whacked the tiger out of my way  But the tiger took me down like a prey  Then I took the tiger away  And In the zoo you see him today   The cat is prowling through the night  He will surely give you a fright   When I cry my mother is always there to cheer me up.  When I argue she says not to.  When I win sports and bring the prize to her she’s happy.  As I always wanted her to be.  She is the one I really love.  No matter what happens.  Every child does the same.  They love their mother  Because…  She is the one who:  Feeds us  Loves us  Cares about us  And the most important thing  She brought us in to this world  I love my MOTHER.   Once I dreamt of being a rockstar.  I went to a mall where I had to perform, it was lovely.  People were listening to my music.  But I was woken up for school.  I wished it was true.  After that dream, when I grew up  I became a real rockstar.  All those years of wishing  Came true.   There once were two sisters,  who were very alike,  everything was identical about them,  even their bike.  They ate together,  played together,  from morning to night,  everyone thought their relationship was brilliant and right.  Until one day,  they had a brother to share,  who’s going to have him?  They gave each other a stare,  he’s mine said the big one,  we are going to have some fun,  no said the little one,  he’s mine to keep,  this made the big one weep.  This feud kept going,  until the brother was one,  he opened his mouth and said,  “Lets all go and play together in the sun”.  The sisters glared at each other with glee,  “We can all play together… see”.  So together the three of them went to play,  and happily forever they were meant to stay. <img alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" src="http://poetryzone.co.uk/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;"/>   My mum is obviously the best mum on Earth  she is my best friend  she talks things through with me  she stands up for me  my mum is the best mum EEEVVVEEERRR   Faye is my princess  She is gorgeous  She deserves every little good comment in the world  She is my SISTER   Skye is beautiful  She is the best goaly  She can do anything  Even eat a whole roast dinner  SHE IS THE BEST SISTER EVER   One moment I was in the air  Above the clouds, nowhere to be found  One moment I was below the Earth  In its core I’d bound   I once had a strange box  Which had everything you coluld want  From onions and potatoes  To a big restaurant   Reports, reports they are everywhere,  Wherever you go, wherever you are,  Reports are just sitting there.  School reports are cool  But you get them every year.   Fairground smells like lots of ice cream out of snowy lands,  And lots of stinky petrol on the grassy wonderland.  Fairground tastes like cotton candy made out of soft clouds.  Hot dogs and frizzy drink, I like them a lot.  At the Fairground feels like sweating hands with only 10 pounds.  Fairground sounds like lots of people laughing or crying.   we all have it  we all need it  but yet we don’t use it  we walk past those with misfortune without a second glance  we don’t spare the time to help others  so we might as well be heartless  if you are one of many stop and think  we all have heart  so use it  and let life do the rest   No one is a criminal  No one is an addict  No one is a failure  No one is wrong.  But we all are human  so please see on.   Stay with me,  till you die.  Stay with me,  till I say goodbye   My name is Tyler  I have lots of friends I like  Everyone is nice  My grandad is so nice   Mother Nature was happy in those times  She loved the way the sun would shine  Blinding white against a tranquil blue sky  Wisps of cloud floating up high   Food is yummy  Food is good  Always eat food  That tastes so good  Always eat healthy  Fresh fruit and veg  Eat red meat and fish as well  It makes your brain think just as well  Puddings are okay, but in small doses   I have a strange brother  And he does weird things  He likes to dance in the open  And also likes to sing   If you come near  I’ll eat your soul  And no one will escape  Not even a mole   Oh Summer!!!  How long have I been waiting for you?  Oh, those cold, bitter winters  Oh, I hated it, it’s true   Once you see helpfulness  You’ll be helpful  Like everyone in the world like you  You will be as amazing as others​   When I am alone  I never fear  On the beach  Or on the pier.   Forgiveness is just like love,  Forgiveness is pure as a dove.  We all have it somewhere in our minds,  We have to forgive, as it’s just so kind.  God forgives us all too,  I can forgive anyone, even you.  Just think about it,  Anyone can do it,  Forgiveness is a powerful gift,  You have to win it!   I’m sorry l didn’t come  I was busy skating  sorry I left you waiting.  And getting in mom’s car  was pretty hard.  Putting the equipment away  is one of the reasons l stayed.  I’m sorry l’m late.   In the deep blue sea  Teeth as sharp as deadly knives  bringing death to prey   Food, food, who doesn’t love food?  Fried chicken, lamb and meat  Candy galore, sweets and stuff  For all you can eat   How do you be a baby?  I really don’t know  Is it by sucking your nail?  Or sucking your toe?   I have a magic pen  To make pictures come to life  I can draw a frying pan  Or even a real knife   Spring’s here, spring’s here  a happy jolly time  Spring’s here, spring’s here  the music and the rhyme  We love spring, the beautiful days  even though it has different ways   I know it’s late  But please let me go  Even if I could stay  Just for an hour or so   flowers, flower, flowers  in different shapes and sizes  red  orange  yellow  green  blue  purple   There is a potato that shines  He loves going to the star mines  He will shine always  He is in a shine craze  He has lots of nice, shiny lines   I love my friends.  Some are small, some are tall.  Long hair, short hair, I love them all  We play and laugh,  We laugh  And play until the end of every day.

One big unicorn was happy and free  As long as he was rich and it could be  Three little kittens made his upside down  And made him drown as he was brown  He was happy, ha ha ha  He was sad, oh ahh.  One day he walked off because,  He was sad without a cause  Little kittens changed his mind  Without any trouble he was a mastermind.   Today was the worst day of my life,  I woke up MUCH too early for my liking.  The next thing I know,  I have to go hiking.   Let me sleep  I want to sleep a bit more  I want to have some rest  So please stop knocking on the door   My pet dog is the best  He can do tricks  He can shake hands  He can fetch sticks   My awesome granny  I have a granny  Who is so cool  When she was small  She never went to school   Nappies are plushy and fluffy  Nappies are squishy and soft  Nappies are white and big  Nappies are miniature clouds   Oh dear, oh my,  My brother just dropped the pie,  That was for the wedding on the 4th of July,  Oh dear, oh my!   My friend has a talking dog  That likes to sit on a log.  When he gets a bone that’s new  All he does is chew, chew, chew.   There was a girl named Savannah  She ate a talking banana  When she went for a walk  And her stomach started to talk   Oink! Oink!  goes the pig  Rolls in mud  and has so much fun  Oink! Oink!  goes the pig  so cute and  adorable   Bright sun  with a  sparkling  light,  animals  living with  me.   A round ball bounced  a hungry tiger pounced  Everyone was shocked  when the boat rocked   What colourful butterflies!  The butterfly is a beautiful insect.  I love butterflies.   The sea is beautiful,  It is sparkly,  It is shiny,  It is smiley,  It will make you happy,  It will make your dreams come true.   It’s just been Christmas!  That was in the past,  My parents said be a good girl  or you won’t get what you asked.   A bright green stripe  down my curly ginger hair,  a leaf green dress  matched with two white boots  Never make a mess  on any sort of wish,  I’m Lucky, the Irish Leprechaun.   It is hot in here  I don’t know why  because it is morning  and it is sunny  and it is 36 degrees  and that means it’s very hot  now it is 900 degrees  that means you are going to die  now it is better  and it is 12 degrees   How did Holi start?  Holi is a festival  Holi is fun  How did it start?  It started with a son  The son of a devil  Who thought he was god  But his son knew what was true  And knew that his father was a fraud  He prayed to the real one  Annoying his father very much  Who put up some traps  Like mice in his lunch  But the son was too clever  And got out of each one  I mean it’s pretty rare  For a father to be fooled by his son  Then in the final test  He asked his son to sit on a fire  He said he would be okay  Wow, wasn’t he a liar?  Then the son sat  And he of course prayed  And when he was burning  God came to his aid  And that’s how Holi started  Wasn’t it a fun story  About Prahlad  And Haraynkashap?   Flowers are colourful,  flowers are twinkly,  flowers are beautiful,  flowers can make you shine.  They can make you smile,  they can make you joyful,  they can make  you smile  all day long   Space above, so bright  Space above, twinkling through the night,  All the planets in space,  They all start playing the chase,   We all know  The story of the lion  It’s mean and lazy  And kills everything.  But the thing  We haven’t appreciated  Is its full natural beauty  The way it strolls across the plains  In such a formal elegance  Its shaggy furry mane  So, really  If you think about it  Lions are beautiful creatures  Worthy to the Earth   today is spring  lots of fun  today is spring  in the sun  maybe when it’s winter time  you will cry and cry  and cry   I am sad  I am blue  but I think we  should be nice too  so let’s have joy  and play with toys  and have a party  with our voice.   I have two sisters  I have two sisters  one of them is nice  one of them is rude  the rude one says dude  the nice one says dice  but am I rude or nice?   Just like aliens  People argue,  If they really are real  Or just a fake silly myth.  I have to say  They must exist  Or how would I know  About the Shopping Monster?  He’s big and blue  And lives at White Rose.  You might have seen him  Strolling about.  He’s my friend  And gives me vouchers,  For my favourite shops.  I don’t know his name  So for now,  I just call him…  Oh yes…  Jim.   My mum is so sweet  so kind  so lovely  so caring   Once there was a little dog who got stuck inside a log,  and got lost inside the woods.  He met a porcupine and now he’s feeling fine,  and now it is the END and he’s found a little friend.  I hope you come back soon  I hope you come back soon.   Every person has an opinion,  Especially for aliens  Some say they were never real  I certainly disagree!  Aliens are cool  Aliens are awesome  But they’re certainly not  Things that don’t exist.  I have a vision  Of an alien.  He has green skin  That oozes everywhere  He wears a tux  And goes two  But worst of all  He eats rabbit poop soup!   Chocolate chocolate how are you made?  I’m squished and squished  and squoshed and squoshed  and shaked and shaked  and baked and baked.  Mr. Willie Wonka tried my food  He said OH WOW THAT’S GOOD A TEE GOOD!!!  Then we sent it back to England  and that’s how choco-late is MADE!!!!   Out of space  I can see comets  And meteors .  On the moon I can see craters.  Standing on Saturn it is cold.  On Jupiter the planet is ice cold.  I’m sitting on the sun even though  I am boiling hot all around.    A poem about cerebral palsy    I have a pet pony,  now I am not lonely.  Just taught it a trick,  now time does not tick.  She is my only pet,  and she is not even one yet.   Far, far away lives space  away the stars sway  spinning round and round  away they say  the world is spinning slowly  and slowly the world goes  spinning through the solar system.   It’s my birthday today  please say hooray  please don’t get me anything grey  please bring a special cake  and make sure it is not fake  Please take me out  because there’s a mouse  in the house  I’m not very keen  I’m not even a bean or a queen  Sorry  she said sorry for what?

Better than the rest  that’s why I’m so obsessed  You can play and say Hey!  Let’s not play with boring clay  Have fun with dogs  definitely not logs  as long as there are no frogs  Take it to the park but not into class  in case it might break the glass   Our toys are just joys  we play as well as throw  mostly when were low  Sometimes we can be like a glow  in the hall.  When I play with a ball  I feel very tall  as tall as a castle.  Children play on any normal day  just say I love my toys  HEY!  WHAT A WONDERFUL TIME OF DAY  We can play hide and seek  I promise I won’t peek  I went to the shop and got a lot  a candle stick maker to go with my grater  a doll that was as small as a ball  a dog as big as a log  and the best of all  a ginormous toy car that moved.   dear mom  you are cool  I love you so much  I know you love me too  PS did I make you sad?   Now Gurtle is sad his poem is not here  Now he started to live in the air  Poem people please post Gurtle’s poem if you care   Someone changed my poem and I think I know who  These people who watch me alter and change  They think we need to change but I say, says who  They really stink like dead possums but they need to stop  It’s making me mad!!!!!!  P.S I’m Gurtle!   A turtle named Gurtle is my friend  He’s with me to the end  He might eat fish and dog food  But he’s alright for a little shell back  This poem does not rhyme but it  Does not matter as long as I have  Gurtle  Wait, where did he go???   I saw a bat and then a cat  I see people just like me  But they’re different if you would see  I like everything which is me   I like turtles  I like them  His name is Gurtle  And that is him  Gurtle the Turtle   Go to space, yeah go to space  The moon is shining bright  These are the planets you can see  Uranus, Mars, Jupiter, Satan, Neptune and Earth  These are the planets you can see  It’s never too late, yeah  Never too late  So come and visit Earth, Earth  It’s never too late  So go to space but remember it’s not a race  Oh, but look now, it’s time to say goodbye  The stars are twinkling and the moon is shining bright  It’s time we get in our rocket as we say  GOODBYE   Are you lonely, Moon?  You giant white balloon.  You have no water, wine or air.  No wonder nothing lives up there.  You can’t grow trees or flowers or grass.  Your soil is only rocks and glass.  Even your light is not your own.  Instead it is from the sun that shone.  Your gravity is weak, I hear.  You really have no atmosphere.  But don’t cry  For I still have you in the sky.   Space is a place to discover new things!  Pluto is amazing!  Astronauts travelling all around the solar system!  Comets shooting down to Earth!  Everyone, travel to space before your time is up!

These are all to do with Space   Make a change   Walking up the garden path  I spy yummy sweets  Halloween is here again  Knock knock knock!  Trick or treat.   Nicky is the color of a nut  and Bicky is the color of a biscuit,  sometimes I’m tempted to say  “Oh come you mutts!”  because they sometimes run away  and are not afraid to risk it.   My cat is called Bob,  he likes to jog  all day long,  with his friend called Mog.  We go to the woods,  we sit on a log,  whilst watching the dogs  picking up the sticks.   I love to ride my Heelys  I love to listen to songs  I can’t live without my laptop   The birds are smiling,  The flowers are as happy as the sun,  The flowers drink water,  The birds eat food,  The birds are happy as they fly,  The tree tops are hanging with a sigh,  The animals make sounds,  Happy I am to see the animals dancing,  The animals are soft and cute as a pie.   Do what you said  Do your work  Don’t mess with your partner’s stuff  Do what you said   There was a little turtle  he lived in a box  he swam in puddles  and he climbed on rocks  He snapped at a mussel  and he snapped at a flea,  he snapped at a minnow  and he snapped at me.  He caught the mussel  and he caught the flea,  he caught the minnow  but he didn’t catch me   While riding on a plane to Spain,  love falls for water as rain.  Did you know that love is main?  Love is main.  No more rain.  Love is main.   small cow, very quiet  but likes to cause a big riot…   When Jimmy Tom goes to school  he is always soaked from the pool.  He never works in writing class,  and when recess comes he’s always last.  For when Jimmy Tom goes to school,  it’s never good for the school,  for I won’t be the first to know  when Jimmy Tom goes to school.  For the school all knows  that he’ll be wearing a pantyhose.

I made it out of clay.  I made noodles in it  Every single day.   Once I was sitting in a tree  then a girl came up to me  she said, Are you my dad?  I did not know what to say  so I said, Yes  she was happy  I went home  I was homeless  but I did not tell her  then I heard a knock  it was her dad   I’ll soar through the skies  Like a flying bird  I’ll fly with my friends  I’ll go with the herd   So right now  I’ll tell you the story of my life  This is basically my life  So relax sit back and enjoy   Okay, so today I’ll make a gingerbread house  I want it to be pure chocolate and very sweet  And I want it to be purely edible  And if anyone wants they can eat   I have a set of magic crayons  From which I can draw anything  From a small crab to  A beautiful pair of wings   I love your books   In my dreams, in Codie’s Wonderland  where the sea is purple  and such things as bright green sand  is possible  in Codie’s Wonderland   Zig Zags  Don’t have tags  Zig Zags  Don’t have bags  Zig Zags  Do little tiny wags  Zig Zags  Do have mags.   This day is all  about love  It’s a true story  about a dove  This day is all  about pink  The true story is…  …I’ll give you a wink   Make a cake,  Fighting for survival,  Make a cake   Pancakes   I went to the zoo one sunny day  I met some animals, hip hip hurray.  I saw tigers and lions roaaaaarrr  That was the end of my good day   Why life is different  Why life is different  The stray cats are in the garbage can  The garbage truck sent them to Paris  So the stray cats climbed the Eiffel tower  And the stray cats got stuck up there   Once there was a duck  who lived on a lake  She wanted bee  but how could she get one?  One day she saw a bee  She almost ate it  She grabbed it  and put it in the water  and it was dead   Have you ever smelt summer?  Sure you have.  Remember that time  When you were travelling  And feeling sick  From the twisting and turning car?  That was summer.   Mr Chewbacca Fuzzypants, our cat  gets called stupid names  like Tabs, or Tabby, or Chew.  He does gross things  (you don’t need to know!)  He wakes me up every morning  How cheeky is that?  I don’t want to get up at 6.30am.   Apple is orange and blueberry green  oranges, too, pineapple is blue.   In the class there is teacher  The teacher is cool, she is twenty two  She is so cool  She can sing and dance, she is such fun  In the class there are kids, they like to yell, yell  When the teacher teaches she has to yell  The class is so cool and all the people in it   We go to the wedding,  We have fun,  We dance, and sing along,  We eat food, climb up the stage  To see the groom and the bride shine,  We see every one of our relatives,  We all laugh, talk and cheer,  There are different songs and lights,  And everything we want,  After all it is the wedding tonight!   I was walking down the street when I heard a call,  It sounded like it came from the mall,  When I soon found it right in a hall,  A kid out know gave me a ball,  It had a button and he told me to push it,  But instead I hit it,  Soon a little turtle that was blue,  He also stood on two,  Next he sent out a little dragon like thing,  He told me they were Pokémon staters that must be,  I know what they do I play the video game,  So it had a battle of fame,  Then my little friend was mine,  But I told him to dig but he made a mine,  I took he home after the fight,  My mom had a fright,  I took him to a lab,  Which was a home for him,  So was on my way,  But then I woke up.   The paper planes fly over you,  A swish as a note flies over your head,  Whispering to one another,  ‘I don’t get it, do you?’ they said.   An open book, a new world,  A new perspective, beyond my eyes unfurled.   Who said I had to have one word,  Not two or three or five?   The planes are flying,  The guns are shooting,  Conflict is roaring,  And air raids are hooting.   All across the land,  Time stood lifeless,  All for that one man,  He stood alone.   When the air is right,  And the screams are ringing,  The rip will create,  Onto the crate you’ll be clinging.   Dark and mysterious,  Hung in the sky,  Beautiful and calming,  Just passing by.   Coral, pink and porcelain,  Sculpted with precision,  Once a swan is shimmering waters,  In a loving position.   Boom, Bang, Boom, Bang,  The bullets pierced the night,  Boom, Bang, Boom, Bang,  We tried to stay out of their sight.   There is a little girl,  She doesn’t know who she is.  Who loves fruity mint swirl,  Also likes things that fizz.   Let cats keep on screeching and scratching,  For God has made this to keep lasting.  Let all the tigers eat and growl  As that’s their nature, keep it how it is now.   I was alone  Listening to the Hamilton soundtrack  and then Burr came into my room and said:  Hamilton is love  Hamilton is life   Owls  Underneath a tree.  Tortoises  Slowly walk  I see a  Duck lay  Eggs, as I walk through the rain.   I was swimming deep down under  I saw a creature with long blonde hair  A tail like a fish  But the top like a human  It was magical  It was a mermaid  She showed me around  But I knew I had to go  So I waved good bye  And off I went   Best friends are there for you  They never let you fall  If you do  They pick you back up  If you’re sad  They know what to do  You have a good laugh  and they love you   War is a something  you’ve never seen before  War is a dangerous thing  You can lose control  There are toxic gases, guns and bombs  The soilders have suffered  But the souls remained shuttered.  There won’t be any hope  There won’t br peace  The poppies will grow  And the war will close   Ggvhhejvhfejhfdvuhvvfejhvfjhghhjvei  hugehggidgoiheoihquoihguieuigfiugfreiug  wiguiuhjgrgjiegriugfuifiugrihufrwguiriugerijhrfuhireiuguhewugiwugifuhireuwihewuuhruhu I jhvewjvjgvnvj  webkjdfjgkewkjvewkjndwejkvwdejkv  wekdjvewifgvwegjvwegvkwevgjf  weknvewnvjfnvkwednkvdewvnk  dewkvgwedvnkwedgjvwdegjvevgjd  wewdegifgfjegjwdevgjvxjhtaeeRgghgdehgd  heghhhhhhyhbhbhurgyufrduhwedgie  hkjhwekjhwjhewjhiwekjhwejkfd  wejkwfejkfewkjewfijfewijfdwkjfdewk  jefwkhjdwekjgwdeiwjdgewjdieggjwiehjwidei  wjgdedweijhijwdheijedwhdjhwej  hewfwwfewefjifweifjwewefiteiftwhg   There once was a girl named Kelly  She was a little bit smelly  She was just sad  That her parents got mad  For not showering her like sister Nelly   On my very first day at Hogwarts,  I walked on the train to find a new friend.  Oh, I walked and I walked, when suddenly  I became face to face with Harry Potter!!  Two people on either side,  On the train, on my very first day at Hogwarts.  Defeat, You Know Who Harry Potter,  Defeat, defeat, defeat.  Say hello to my best pals,  Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, aid famous Harry.  I am the famous Harry Potter,  I can defeat Voldemort and have done it 3 times.  Stop sayin’ that it freaks me out!  Exclaimed Ron.  True, it freaks me out too, inturupted Hermione.  And the next thing you know  we were at Howarts School Of Witchcraft and Wizardry!!!    This is a poem composed by pupils of 4 Avon for our class topic.     This was composed by pupils of 4 Teme for their class topic, The Egyptians.    I flew to the moon  On my magic carpet…  I saw an alien, a spaceman,  An artist drawing the moon,  And archer aiming his arrow at a crater!  Then I got back into my rocket  And flew back to Earth.   This monkey is crazy!  He wags his tail  He dances on branches  He is a c-r-a-z-y monkey!  He rides on people’s heads  He steals their clothes!  Monkey is… my crazy pet!   My shoe, my shoe  Look at my shoe  It is flying in the air  Like a bird, too!   Bird, bird  Look at me!  I can do loop the loop with you!   Mummy, I love you to the moon and back  Mummy, you are the best of all  Mummy, I love you, I love you, I love you  I don’t know what I would do without you  Mummy, Mummy, with all my heart  I will be kind and buy you things  Mummy, Mummy, with all my heart  It’s time for me to say a big  thank you   Goodbye fourth grade, hello fifth grade  We’ve made great memories that won’t fade   Today was the worst day at school!  My teachers were shouting  My coat got lost   Auntie Helen was 82 years old  When her eyes were closed and arms were afold.  She died a few weeks ago  And this is something that I know.   Too many snacks  A hotdog, a pancake  A piece of cheese  And about pizza  Oh yes please!!   Life of a Butterfly  Fluttering here and there  Searching for flowers  Making baby plants  With its magical powers   Once a little guest came in our house  And it was a cat, who was stray  So we gave her some food  And she started to come here everyday!   Fun uncle .  Mysterious looker.  Soon to be father.  Noisy person .  Loves children.  Rock and roller.  Noise hater.   4 or less just ignore.  5 or more, add 1 more   I’m outa space  I can’t go any other place  I’m trying to win a race  but I can’t see a trace  when I’m outa space   In my dreams I found something with magic,  In my dreams I saw something with a horn,  In my dreams it was a rainbow,  In my dreams it was a unicorn.   Love is love,  love is amazing,  love is wonderful,  love is great.  Love is an ingredient,  love is the best,  Love is everything,  so use it with a guest.

I’m seven, I’m seven  I feel like I’m in heaven  I like being me,  I feel so free  I’m seven   Once there was a little girl,  She doesn’t know who she is.  Who loves fruity mint swirl,  Also likes things what fizz.   I awake, it’s midnight, I know I must sleep  But I hear the sound of an owl’s beak  I feel I must explore the night  I’ll look at the forest in the moonlight   I have braces  I got them on the 7th March 2016.  I have nearly had them on a year!  They hurt a little bit but not too much (which is good).  I have wax to protect my lips  to stop the braces rubbing on my lips.  I get my braces tightened every 10 weeks  to move my teeth to make them straight!   If you are like me  And you like to eat  Fridge will be heaven  For it’s filled with juice and meat   Bulling is not right,  be safe online   Three friends  One bed  How we all fit in?  No idea  Half past ten  Still not in bed   Feel the cold breeze  Look at the dancing trees   Wishes???  Once when my mother refused to buy me an ice cream  I sat on my desk and wished a wish  I wished I could get ice-cream everyday  For breakfast, dinner, lunch or any dish   See comment.   The Three Early Birds  went for a walk  but then a nasty wolf  came out for both  had a bump  and had the three early birds for lunch   Lush, milky, sweet, solid  Rewarding, sugary, treats,  Brown, sweet, chunky   Brown, lush, rewarding  turn into mouth watering…  rewarding treats!   Houses  What house do you live in?  Is it red or blue?  But most importantly does it suit you?  Is your house cozy?  Or is it like a flat?  If you want, you can change it like that!  Is your house pretty?  Come on in and sit,  Maybe we can spice your house up,  Just a little bit!  All our houses are pretty,  In their own special way,  But in the next generation,  Will they stay?   Did you know the story of the Coin?  If not, I’ll tell you right now,  He was golden and shiny,  Way too clean to be run around.  One day a dollar note came,  To teach him a lesson,  To stop him thinking about himself  and start thinking of others!  He said Yes, but in his mind,  He really didn’t agree.  The very next day, he sat at home,  looking at the mirror &amp;  watching TV!  Then he decided to go outside  And see what was going on!  But to his dismay, he saw not  a single mirror, nor a single play.  So he went to the dollar note,  to ask for some advice,  to make his life perfect again,  Without thinking twice.  So the dollar note asked if he  had been caring.  So the Coin shook his head and said  he wasn’t daring!  He went back and gave a penny,  he found it rather pleasant,  and gave to his sister Jenny,  One by one, he gave away to the  children filled with joy,  Later then he gave each of them  Yet another toy!  Soon his life changed to all good,  And then thanked the Dollar note  Very very much!   I wouldn’t have any fun in school  At first I thought everyone was mean  But one week through and I got everything  None of this could’ve happened if it wasn’t for:   The police and firefighters are my friends  There is a show I like about firefighters  It is called Chicago Fire  There’s another called Chicago PD  I love those shows!   Mrs Halon is my teacher,  Sometimes when something  surprising happens she says,  Holy Tolleetto!  She really likes sea turtles  She likes the beach too  That is why I like her as my…  TEACHER!   My best friend and me  have fun  like playing together and talking to my mum  School is where we first met  and we sometimes make silly bets   Hi friends  I’d just like to say thank you  for all your kindness to me  This is for:  Abbie  Robyn  Grace  Chloe  C.J.  h cm  Sophia  Hollie  Lexi  Felix  Kacie  THANK YOU SO MUCH  MADDIXXXX   Oh, Garry Barlow  why won’t you sing a duet with Mrs Stone?

A frog came up and said, Oh  I have been looking for you all my life.   As I walk to my school  I see  a bird   When we see snowflakes  We gasp with joy  And sing all day  A magical song   Friends are like stars  You can’t see all of them  But you know they are always around  So you can always count on them   As I look up above I see clouds  I see cirrus clouds like a horse’s tail  I see cumulus clouds, big white and fluffy  I see a stratus cloud covering the sky in a white blanket  but then the sky disappears  and then I see nimbus clouds, big dark clouds  then rain comes down and lightning strikes  but after all the water droplets are gone from the cloud  the sun heats the world again   You are the best  Every day is always good for you  But it is good for everyone else  So don’t act like you’re the best  Appreciate everyone   So sporty  Not into dance  Good at running  Girls are good  More into gymnastics  Love boys/girls at sport   One misty night  James came to kill  He saw a person  Blue jacket  Red jeans  He looked suspicious  Don’t try this at home   Anglo-Saxons like to write stories  They write them all day  It’s good to be ancient  And never be down  So be an Anglo-Saxon all day round   Some people get to school in the car   In a Halloween night  I saw strange things with a candle light.   I went to the doctor the other day,  the doctor said, “What’s your name?”  I said, “Um um um oh no I forgot.”  “I know my name,” I said  “I just can’t remember.”  “Hurry up, I don’t have long.  There’s a queue crowded round the door.”  15 minutes later I was still in the room.  Then the doctor asked, “Why are you here?”  “I can’t remember,” I said  “But I’ve remembered my name.”   “May and Izzy, this is time for us to go to the top of Big Ben!”  “Hollie, that’s a great idea!”  “Thanks, May!”  “We need to get there before midnight strikes guys!”  “We know Izzy!”  “Come on girls, move your butts!”  “Okay, calm down, Hollie!”  “Izzy, what’s the time?”  “IT’S in two minutes to twelve!” #Time Lapse  “Good we’re on top!”  “Let’s start the PARTY!”  DAB DAB DAB #DABBING FOR LIFE!   People sign up for war,  Some say two much blood on the floor,  Families cry,  As many die.   I like my cat  Love each other  Of schools for a week  Very good the is week  Each of ERS be kind   Blue is bright  Blue is great  Blue is a common colour  Blue is a colour for anyone  Blue is a colour that you can get many shades of   Chinese New Year  Houses are cleaned  I collect ang paus  Need to give ang paus  Exciting  Supermarkets are full  Every location is filled   A milk drinker  A dog hater  A mouse chaser  A string lover  A day dreamer  And best of all,  When they drink milk,  Their fur always stays  As smooth as silk.   There once was a book,  Who liked to look,  For all of his new friends.   Blue is the shimmering sea,  Blue is as good as can be.   Pugs are cute,  you can dress them in a suit,  or maybe a panda could dress as a pug,  to make “PandaPug” ?   Oh bird  Oh bird  Don’t go away  Oh bird  Oh bird  Please can you stay?   When I started singing  Why did everyone run away?  Did they have something else to do?  Or were they having a bad day?

Brown is the soil  that I see everywhere.  Brown is a tree  with no leaves.  BROWN IS THE PLANTS THAT DIED.  BROWN IS THE MUD IN THE SKY  THAT FALLS DOWN.  Brown is an ant  that is everywhere.  Brown is the insect that crawls  in the garden.  Brown is the dog that barks.   My friends Maddi and Izzy are awesome friends to have,  They can also give you support when you need it  (when you’ve hurt yourself or need help),  Maddi goes to bed at: 8:30 on a school night  and Izzy goes to bed at : 9:00 on a school night  and I don’t really stay up late,  I stay up at: 7:30 and 8:00 on a school night.

Purple is an octopus that  flies in the sky.  Purple is a diamond that  shines in the sky.  Purple is a dress  that dances in  the bright moon.  Purple is a fish that  smells like a violet  in the bright sky.  Purple is a sound  that came to  my ear on the bright grass.  Purple is the snake  that moves slowly  across my violet sky.   yellow is a tasty lemon that squishes  into the juicy sun.   Blue is the sky  that makes things fly.  Blue is a juicy blue berry  that is mushy.  Blue is the sea  that has beautiful whales  in the water.  Blue is St Georges school uniform.  Blue is my dad’s blue eyes.   Purple feels like the  beautiful petals  of a violet.  Purple is a drop of juice  that falls like petals.  Purple smells like the sweet plums  that I love to eat  Purple is a flower  singing.  Purple is a tithers  that is in Daniela   Pankhurst Class is the best  even with my best teacher, Mrs Stone.  They always help me with lessons,  they are the best class ever because they’re awesome  You are nice Pankhurst Class   Gold shimmers like a King’s crown,  you have to bow to him.  Gold is money  for a wishing well  that you chuck  in for a wish.  It is a scary alien  that says eeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrr.  It is a karate suit  to guide his  karate.  Gold is a gigantic  cannonball  that shoots copper coins.   Blue is the colour of the  sea waiting for the  blue sky to come  and be its friend.   Blue is the sky  dropping tears in the night  swish  swash  all winter night.  Blue is a dolphin  that swims all day  in the magic clouds.  Blue feels like  a flying ball on the beach.  Blue tastes like  a grape falling off a tree.  Blue looks like  a colourful falling  leaf.  Blue is hearing  a whale that swims  in the bath.   Purple shines  like the moon  shining in the sky.  Every time stars  shine it is  beautiful.  The purple of the  night waiting for the moon  reflecting the stars’ purple.  Purple tastes like flowers  in the sun in the morning.   Red is fire  that burns the world  destroys the earth  leaving small pieces of rocks.   Grey is a rhinoceros  that goes faster than a man  his horn is like metal  and his feet  stamp the floor.   Yellow is a sun  in a yellow sky  that has happy  illumination.  Yellow tastes  like banana in a  tropical sun.  Yellow is all the yellow  things that turn  the planet to  yellow in one minute  Yellow is another dimension.   Green is an emerald  that shines and glimmers  Green are leaves that  fall in Autumn and  live on in Spring  Green are frogs that make  a percussion with  their croaking  Green makes my feel  happy like a flower  dancing on the moon  Green make my feel excited  like the first day of school.  Green makes feel big  like a giant or a T-REX   Purple is a blanket that  covers my eyes,  when the the sunset appears.  Purple is a flower dancing,  when the wind pushes her calmly  as a teddy bear.  Purple is a tasty grape,  that explodes in my mouth  Purple is a beautiful perfume  that people put on their hair  when they go out.   Pink is a flower that shines in the sun  and sleeps during the night.   There’s a fancy dress competition tomorrow  And I can hardly wait  I don’t know what I’m going to dress as  But I know it’s going to be great   I always win  When it comes to arguments  I always win as you can see  Unless it’s my mum  Or a little baby   So I know I just wrote the poem “fancy dress”  And this is a poem on clothes too  But still, no one minds a clothes poem  Or in this case, a few   Sometimes I sit and wonder.  About stuff I don’t know.  Like what the heck the earth was like.  A hundred years ago.   My dream house will have 2,000 floors  with beautiful bells around every door.  My dream house will have soft white beds  with pink bedspreads.  My family, me and my elders  will live in it with many helpers.  I will get the best cook  and lots of books.  My dream house will have silver chairs  and soft teddy bears.  How I wish that my dream house will pop out  at this moment and there is no doubt.   There is a cat  trying to catch a rat,  but the rat ran away.  So the cat sat on its hat.  PAT, PAT ,PAT   Lord, you bless us, family and friends.  Your love never ends.

And soon the story will soon be told  of the Legendary Plate   Magic is not always there,  But if you look with a lot of care,  You could find what you want to be there,  Whether it’s mermaids, fairies, unicorns or elves,  The first thing to do is find the magic in yourself,  If you believe it will come to you,  Anything can happen which you want to.

Camel rider  Desert transporter  Planet finder  Time machine creator  Treasure hunter  Starter surfer   I will put in my tray  The crack of coins crunching and clashing together,  A spotty lion slowly playing the piano,  A horse galloping as fast as his legs could carry him into the fields.   Waiting, waiting,  For the sign of life.  Waiting, waiting,  For my future.  To wait is to live.  To live is to love.  So be patient and wait.  Wait for love.   When the night time comes, and it’s time to go to bed,  The lights go out, the quilt gets tucked,  then thoughts rush through my head.   Pop pop pop  popstar  popcorn pop  here pop  there pop  everywhere we go  there is a POP!   Last night, I saw the classroom growing,  Flowers jumping out the soil,  Leaves dancing to the sound of the wind  Dancing up and up   Nocturnal  Noisy  Funny  Good  Is all that he does  for he has sharp teeth  and chestnut brown hair  Strong and bold  Annoying on his wheel  but I still love him.   We play together,  We cry together,  And we will never fall apart  Until the end of our lives  NO MATTER WHAT.   If you want me to drive you crazy  and rattle on your door   Cuddly  Attackers  Trouble makers  Sweet   I know I have to leave one of you for a year,  But that will never change us.   I like to read before I go to bed,  Before I rest down my little head,  At the moment I’m reading many books,  I often read whilst my mum cooks,  Harry Potter is the main one,  But when I carry them all they weigh a ton!   Technology makes games,  Games can be anything,  And games can do this…  Games can make you adventure,  And take you into an unknown world,  Games allow you to relive ages,  And use your imagination,  You may not see it but you’re sucked into…  A world of technology.  Technology grows bigger each day,  And Virtual reality will put you in places,  You would never think you’d be able to visit.   The chirping birds sound so sweet  The clear blue sky oh! So high…   We are all little kids at heart  We look like adults, we act like adults  But deep inside, there’s still a little kid…   UFOs travel at the speed of light,  And may give you a big fright,  Although we don’t know who controls them,  UFOs have been seen,  And we know that they are mean.  So when you see a disc in the sky,  You may want to think twice about what you’ve seen.   We argue  We play together  We help each other out  Even though we fight sometimes  You’ll always be my little sister.   I was a daredevil,  I always raised the level,  I got bruises and scars,  But that didn’t stop me from going bizarre   Trolls are sweet, small and kind  Trolls have little feet and hair that smells like candyfloss  Trolls do not nibble your feet  Trolls are not things to eat  Trolls are friends with every creature  Trolls come in every colour:  pink, yellow, orange and red, blue, brown, purple and green  Trolls, we love you  Will you love us to?   Always count on them  Gives good advice  Believe in you   I’ll stay up until twilight  And see the full moon  I’ll stare into the moonlight  And hopefully see an eclipse  I’ll look into the night  And think about the stars,  Twinkling overhead  Lighting up your dreams  I’ll stay up until twilight  And I WILL shine with all my might   She’s a…  Room Trasher  Brother Basher  Phone User  Not a Loser  Boyfriend Bringer  Loud Singer  Hates to Lean  Annoying Queen  Terrible Eater  Easy Sleeper   She’s a …   Most kids have two parents  Some parents are divorced  The children still get to see both parents  Kids still love their parents.

Over a huge hill lives a wicked wizard  With his loving pet lizard  In the witch’s pocket she has a purple purse  Buried with a precious curse   The BFG is not like any other giant,  He’s special, kind and positive,  The positivity inside him is so very strong.  In fact it’s that strong,  He shares it with a little girl called Sophie.  I love the BFG and if YOU don’t like him  then you are a boring person.   I was alone  listening to the Hamilton soundtrack  and then Burr came into my room and said:  Hamilton is love  Hamilton is life   He is my brother,  And he will never be replaced.   Oh thank you, oh thank you,  We will never forget you,  From the day you were born,  Until the day you die,  I won’t lie,  Best freinds are better than gold and silver   You’re my Big Brother  And I love you with all my heart…   Red strawberry,  Orange sunset ,  Yellow banana,  Green grass,  Blue sky,  Purple grapes,  Pink pig.   The subjects at my school are:  maths,  English,  PE  philosophy,  RE,  art,  computing,  and reading.   The forest is a place to explore,  Where no one explores except for me.   Where are they?  Nobody knows  Are they in a bale of hay?  Do they come out in day?   My brother is bright.  My brother is light.  My brother says he might.  My brother is right.  My brother is everything.   Hi, how are you  Is it me or you?  Hello what are you doing?  Hello to you  My dear friend  My dear friend, alright?  Call me names  Call me anxious but  Why?  Why do you ask?

Unicorn searcher  X Factor winner  Treasure finder  Disneyland visitor  Dragon collector  Taj Mahal admirer   Olympic swimmer  Bake off baker  Holiday maker  Time machine creator  Weekend stretcher  Dog walker   Penguins sliding on the ice  all falling over like rolling dice  diving into the deep blue sea  hopefully catching a fish for tea   The forest was the deepest known,  It was said to have been like a throne.  The feeling of it,  The structure of it,  It was starting to feel like home.   There once was a cheese that was green,  It was made out of lots of crushed bean,  It looked very funny  And tasted like honey  So I thought I would best leave it be!   Happiness is seeing your best friend  laugh when you laugh, cry when you cry.  Happiness is that one unexpected bar of chocolate  hiding in your sock drawer.  Happiness is that song you always hear on the radio  and eventually you know the name.  But sometimes happiness isn’t always there.  Sometimes your happiness  gets all used up for a while  and it feels as if a dark cloud  will hover over you forever.  But you can’t give up!  You must keep moving,  take that leap and run.  Run as far as you can from that dark cloud.  You’ll be chasing happiness  and finally, you catch your breath,  and happiness!   Every time a flower blooms we hear  Jolly happy tunes  The big bold colorful sun  Makes the joy for everyone  We are happy  The flowers bloomed  And some day we will pluck them  Soon   My brother  My brother  The cutest baby ever  He’s as cute  As a lute  The cutest boy ever   Reading is like..

She ponders her existence  She thinks about her future  Does it belong  Inside of her true song?  Her true calling in life?   Why me?  Why there?  Why now?  The sun gleaming as I glide to hell   Flowers are beauty  They’re gifts of love.  Things we cherish  That come from above.   Crystal snow dazzling through the breeze  Trees covered in snow  Like frosty ice  It smells like winter weather  And looks extremely like winter wonderlands   You should really see me dance  I wiggle and waggle my body like crazy  Which is quite unusual and impressive  For I’m usually quite lazy   I love my family,  especially my Mummy and Daddy.   Olympic rider  Multi millionaire  Globe trotter  Birds-eye ballooner  Unicorn creator  New country revealer   Last night I saw the classroom breathing  Great guests of tables shouting  Rushing in and pushing out  The doors singing mouths.   Gold outline  Beautiful scriptures  Glass case  Nailed on the wall  Big bold reflection  Lights  Darkness   Last night, I saw the village dancing,  Lots of children,  Dancing and  Prancing away  To the speakers’ singing mouths.   Last night I saw the bedroom awakening  The blinds were blinking lazily  Stretching and yawning  As drawers shouted!   I will put in the hat  The screech of a shooting star on a summer night,   Last night I saw the jungle breathing  Leaves exhaled in and out  Branches wiggled their fingers  And the trees  In the breeze  Put on a show for all to see   I will put in the bag  The soft silk of a blanket  Water from a sparkling waterfall  The trees touching the sky   I will put in my pocket  A snowball fight with my dog  Water from an undiscovered country  The tip of a finger touching a snowflake   I will put in my box   I will put in my pocket,  The swish of a snowy storm,  Ice lays on the Atlantic,  The tip of a tongue touching a snowflake.   The teachers are doing their work  but they think it is boring  My teacher is very strict sometimes   I will put in the velvet bag,  The swish of a dragon’s tail on a dark night,  Water fresh from a waterfall  The tip of a ruler touching paper   I will put in the locker   I will put in my pocket   I will put in the capsule  The shimmer of a star on a winter’s night,  The tip of a leaf touching a branch,   I will put in my tray  The crack of the coins crunching and clashing together,  The spotty lion slowly playing the piano,  The house galloped as fast as his legs could carry him into the fields   I will put in my black boot   I keep in my pocket,   I will put in the Tesco’s bag   I will put in my black boot  The swish of a sparkling five pence coin on Christmas Eve  Water dripping from silly Santa’s fat belly  And Santa’s bottom touching the top of the chimney.   I will put in the top hat   I will put in the chest  A pluck of a string on the Devil’s guitar  The first light of the sun in the horizon  The swift swish of a katanas blade   Oh what lurks in the deep dark sea  Animals and creatures unlike you and me  Tails so long pointy and sharp,  Don’t ever touch it, or explode in a spark  Light of day, day of light  Under the deep dark sea is just some fright  Glow in the darkness, just listen around  Don’t look back if you hear a sound  In the deep dark sea, the deep dark sea…   I keep in my pocket,   I will put in my Tesco’s bag   Sweet, sour, fresh, and bright  The Lemon Tree that stood in sight  Yellow, green and so much more  Left in a basket at your front door  Crisp, soothing, cooling, and soft  Different flavors pop in a loft  Jugs with bows on the table  Smoothness fills the cups with a fable  Thank you Lemon Tree,  Oh, thank you Lemon Tree   I will put in my jar  The swoosh of an owl’s feather on a winters night  Water from the mouth of a Mexican dolphin  The tip of a finger touching a glistening gold ring.   They are on your face,  Always with you,  They make your day and mine all the way through  Sometimes they change but they are not supposed to  They should always stay the same even if you are sad or blue  They make the world a better place a chain link of smiles,  and when we skip along the road they can be seen for miles   Last night I saw the village dancing,  Many children  Rushing in  And running out  To the music of the trees.   Last night, I saw New York partying  The buildings applying light,  And cars sang loudly  Opening and closing their doors  To the beat.   Red moon, yellow moon, blue moon, white  It was there at first sight  Pink moon, green moon, purple moon too  It would be there so would you  Gold moon, gold moon  That’s the moon I want  Because it was there from the very start  My moon, oh my moon, please be there  My moon, oh my moon, please be in the air   Snowflakes, snowflakes everywhere  snowflakes, snowflakes in my hair  Every time a snowflake falls  we are jolly happy dolls  Snowflakes, snowflakes everywhere  we are happy dolls who care   Rain is falling down today  Rain is falling down, hooray!  Come on everyone lets play  Because rain is falling down today   The howls that filled the air, the howls that filled the air  The wolves that were standing there, the wolves that were standing there  A deep dark night filled the day,  The sun went down and disappeared away  Dark trees covered the empty grounds,  As the wolves walked around  Not a movement in sight, not a scurry in the air,  not a sound as a fright, not a deep dark dare  The howls that filled the air, the howls that filled the air  The wolves that were standing there, the wolves that were standing there   For a long time the sun will shine upon us  and surround you  It will guide your way on  There will be a pure light within you  always within you, always within you  For a long time the sun will shine upon us  Giving us happiness   A red tie  As a beautiful crown  Crisp colors fill the air  Scents of flowers, do we care?  Soothing, soft petal leaves rushing the clean frost ground  Of curves and curves  We are going downward,  Down the stem  Rainy droplets seep inside as a morning sun shining in the empty sky  Paper floats, paper floats  As gas in the air of a wind like storm   Not so long ago,  a girl was always on the go,  between music and football,  she’d hardly be at home.  She was kind and funny,  young and sweet,  she was always helping others.  She had one loving brother,  who she would make time for.  She was maybe busy,  but she was always there for others.   What will I do this year?  I know I’ll work with all my might  I’ll see what I did wrong last year  And make it all right   To you I say the New Year is great  For Hogmanay we blissfully wait  Sometimes on Hogmanay we have a dinner  That truly is a winner  And for the dinner I raise a toast  Though I don’t really want to boast  But we had a great feast in Archerfield  And now feelings of good cheer we wield   Oh! When the wind starts blowing  And it starts snowing  We know winter is here  And you might get a frozen ear!   Right upon the high high Law  The jawbone sits on a rock of awe  It sits in its mighty glory  It has a very mighty story  This is very hard to relate  So all we can do is wait and wait   Many days, many nights,  spent with thoughts, and no good nights  alone we stay,  in perilous thought,  for we know, our war was not fought.  Time passes, with its toll,  for, we know that when our time is up  we are left… unforgivable   When the Sun shines  It’s a new day  It’s time to  Send your miseries away   Once I wanted treasure  So I searched how to find some  There were many options  But being a pirate would be most fun   Once there was  One baby bunny  It thought it was adventurous  It thought it was funny   Once I found this stupid person  Who seemed to have a potato for a brain  When he was fractured  He didn’t feel any pain   Once I met a miser  And he was the most irritating person I’ve ever seen  The deals he got were amazing  But still he didn’t like them, as he was so mean   I wake up at 8.  We go to the airport  Which has a great Line! (Boring)  We go to Spain  And there is an even BIGGER line!   I am feeling lucky,  as I am not mucky.  I have not been shouted at.  When we were out I got a new hat.  I got a new car  and I run my own bar.  That’s all I’ve got today,  Bye for now see you at the beginning of May.   A for Amazing  N for Nice  D for Delightful  Y for You are loved   New year, new year  resolutions are here  366 days are gone (that’s because it’s a leap year)  but I must say that it’s been fun.  Some days were good and some days were bad  but, for sure, they weren’t sad.  Goodbye 2016 and hello 2017  I sure liked this little scene   I miss my family  who died a few years ago  Now i’m alone in a little care home  F for Fleur  O for Olivier  U for Ulla  R for Rhemy  I miss my mum Fleur  I miss my dad Olivier  I miss my sister Ulla  and I miss myself Rhemy  I wish i can see them again  but it is impossible   My brothers are annoying  Very annoying  Bs and Ss are always rough  But sometimes they’re sensible  But then they turn terrible  They do a lot of snitching  They give me a lot of stitches  That make me go to sleep  A very deep sleep  Finally I had a rest  From the Bs and Ss   Cartoons, cartoons  like to go kaboom  they make up characters  which sometimes include Monsieur Carter  they also think of silly names like Scorch Supernova  Scorch kind of sounds like he lives on the sun  but i’m sure that is really fun  cartoons, cartoons  they won’t make you snooze   This is my cat  who loves being my lad  but he ruins my mat  and that’s very bad  He hates all the rats  and that is all right  I love to write about my cat  and my brain loves to think   Sight  Might  Fight  Kite  Light   I Woke up at 8,  for Qr’an.  Then I had to have breakfast.  After I got ready to go Ice Skating with my friends!  We Skated for one whole hour (That was long)  We had lunch,  And we went home. (Finally!)   The sun is shining, the grass is green.  The people are clean, the people are clean.  The trees rustle and people show their muscles,  People show their muscles  And it’s always like that at Peckle Berry Road, Peckle Berry Road.  The car vrooms and the butterfly zooms, the butterfly zooms.  The birds tweet and people meet, people meet.  Squirrels jump and land in a hump and land in a hump, land in a hump.  The bees collect pollen and the flowers sway, flowers sway.  Then the other bees, the other bees make honey and give it away, give it away.  The ducks swim but the seagulls always win, seagulls always win.  The leaves wander full of thunder! In Peckle Berry Road, Peckle Berry Road.   it’s great to have friends  a friend like you is cool and special  the biggest gift of life  worth more than 50 Xmas presents  you made me laugh  you made me dry my tears  because of you i have no fears  I love you   Movie time  in the family house  Wait,  I think i just spotted a mouse.

What was that noise?  It sounded like bells.  Could it be?  Santa!   Get along  Right or wrong, no one knows  On task  Understand  Participating  Stay in your group!

I am happy when I have fun with my family (cough)  I am happy basically all the time   On Tuesday we get ready for school.  We come home and I have got to go on Skype.  Then we go somewhere again.   Blue is a colour  Like the sky  Under the shade  Easy on the eye   Children in bed, excited for tomorrow.  Holly on the door.  Rudolph getting ready to pull the sleigh.  Icicles on the window.  Stockings above the fireplace.  Treats all ready for the big day.  Mince pies ready for Santa.  Angel on top of the tree.  Santa’s on his way!   The sand is golden like the sun.  Kids are playing all night long.  As they walk along, the waves on the sand rolls over the beach.  As the kids walk and talk, ice creams drip on the floor.  The sizzling sun is warm and makes people feel happy.  People screaming all day long as the rides go on and on.  Kids go crazy as the day goes by.  The roller coasters spin round and round all day long.  Boing boing! went the bouncy ball.  Then it’s night, time to go home now.  Just remember we had a fantastic day – say good bye!   The waves are the wind.  Boom! went the waves crashing onto the rocks.  We had fun, as the sand hit my hand.  The Beach makes me happy.  It was wet, wet, wet.  White water, shimmered in the reflection of the Moon.  The Sun smiled  I ran like a cheetah!   Hello, I’m Summer  and I like butterflies’   Alex Claire, liked to text without getting any rest.

My castle stands tall and proud  above sad shades of blue and green   He’s funny as a bunny,  but then his tummy started  to ache  when he ate a cake.  He started to be as funny as a bunny  But in May he is like a dummy.   Being sick  Is not my pick,  It needs a kick  Not a lick!  You sometimes get bored  It just can’t be ignored,  Tell your lord  Who probably has a Ford  That being sick  is not my pick.   Christmas is here  With snow and ice  Santa Claus with presents  For those who are nice   Robot, robot stop  Shop, bot!  Hop, bot, hop  Pop, pop!   Christ was born  He is God’s son  Reparing for Christmas is expensive  Is it Christmas yet?  Stockings for presents  Tearing open presents  Meeting your family  At Santa’s grotto, telling him what you want  Santa is the best   Winter is the time to play  In the snow every day.

On Christmas morning  Dressing up the Christmas Tree  Presents under the tree  Joyful songs  Together all day long  Singing jingle bells  Christmas carols  Singing  All day long   Near the sea  I met one of my best friends  Miss Bee.  She cried,”Please help me.”  In finding my hive which was near a tree,  I said, “But first tell me what does it look like?”  When I left my hive last night  There was a thing near it  Which is called a ‘bike’.  After searching a lot  I found the hive,  Which was near a big tree   Winter season’s here  so get in your warm gear  Don’t shed a tear  just get up and cheer  Spring will soon be near  even if your name’s mia  just relax  Winter’s here   My name is Zayn  I got lots of brain  sitting on a train  got a girlfriend called Jain  but my main man Cain  said don’t be a pain  so I went on a plane  met my mate Lain  we went to Spain  where I made it rain  on the lane  I’ll tell you again  my name’s Zayn   My house is a zoo  Seriously, I’m telling you,  Animals everywhere  So… Beware!

I will put in my box  A hurting hand with a handful of scars  A chip of gold in a block of lead  The smashed rock on the sandy sea shore   I will put in the box  The scorching sun crying out small fire balls  The wind’s cold breath on my cheeks  The face of a new-born baby in my arms   I will put in the box  My dog’s protection  Happiness from my birthday  My saddest moment when I watched Dolphin Tale   I will put in the box   I will put in my box  My first ever football game  The kick of a ball with my sibling  The euphonic noise of the crowd at my first goal   I will put in my box  The burning feel of a cobbled path  The taste of Mickey Mouse  And a breathing bridge  stretched across the water   I will put in my box  The flicker of the fire jumping out at me  I will put in my box  The sensational smell of Christmas dinner  when I was as hungry as an alligator   I will put into the box  A piece of the massive mouldy cheese of the moon  A drop of lava from the thundering Mount Vesuvius  The crashing of colossal caving crystal waves   I will put in my box my memories   I will put in the box  The principle spoken word on a stormy night  Flowers from my first outing   I will put in my box  My primary spoken word  My first dog that died on Boxing Day  And having my first sister   I will put in my box  The muddy rugby pitch of my first game  The memory of being carried off the pitch after scoring  The smile of seeing Santa in his grotto  My very first snowman   I will put in the box  The fan of a famous Elephant  Fur of a crazy cookie cat  Sea-salted shells on the sea-shore   The twinkling of the Christmas tree shining over the town  The happiness of my Nan touching my check with her small tight hand  The joy of all the big family together   I will put in my box  A tear tripping franticly down the tight cheek of a pale, tired child  The happiness of setting my eyes upon a dehydrated, dull damaged dog  The enjoyment of awakening to letters swirling round and round my head   In my box   I will put in the box  My singing standing out in the silence  Getting stared at to make me put down my head  Laughing out loud   There were a lot of cats  They always sat on mats  They did not like the bats  That were very fat   1 2 3  is sitting in a tree  4 5 6  is sharing a Twix  7 8 9  are doing just fine  10 11 12’s  Cleaning the shelves   My house is big  What’s a fig,  Sometimes you get bored  A laptop I can’t afford.   It gives me a headache  Just to think about it  Being really hard to do  And can’t be done by a nitwit   I will put in my box  A hurting hand with a handful of scars  A chip of gold in a block of lead  The smashed rock on the sandy sea shore   School is boring, school is dumb but  school is full of lots of fun.  School is helpful to everyone  Sometimes its dumb and full of fun   Snowball fights are just such fun,  But if you’re getting hit by one…  RUN RUN RUN!  Build a snowman with a big top hat,  Carve a face then…  PAT PAT PAT!  Elves sing this song ,  Because their days are long,  “We work all day,  We work all night,  To get your presents,  JUST RIGHT.”   I will put in the box  The feeling of the sunny sparks touching my velvet skin  The swish of the rotten salty sea shivering across the Atlantic  And fire balls flow from the sky like shooting stars in the night   My box   I will put in the box   I will put in the box   I will put in the box   Last night I saw my bedroom dozing  Lamps were dreaming of becoming stars  Whilst cosy quilt covers were cuddling soft teddies   This morning I saw the theatre awaken  Velvet-red curtains yawned  Plush pillows snored  And the columns stretched on the carpeted floor   This morning I saw the rink breathing  Puffing doors exhaled scents fill the air  Mobs of cold winters air rushing through  The winters locked doors   Yesterday I saw Tracy Island waking up  Curved swimming pools opened wide  Tropical trees jumped out of the curled soil  Before lurching backwards to the gentle hum of Thunderbird 2   Yesterday, I saw the classroom arousing,  Curtains opened to the rise of the sun  Chairs untucked themselves  Windows stretched out as the scholars bolt in  Whilst aromas of early morning coffee wandered in  To the tune of birds’ tweets, birds got us on our feet   This morning I saw my bedroom waking up  Teddy bears screaming of the alarm of dawn  Blinds stretching to the beat of the birds’ caws   This evening I saw the stadium awaken  Roof panels stretching  Opening out into a gaping yawn  Ready to prepare for an exciting game.   Yesterday I saw my bedroom awakening  Alarm clocks yawned a piecing scream  Bed-frames groaned at the disturbance  Whilst rugs stretched across the floorboards  And books flew in the air   This morning I saw the stadium rousing  Carbon fibre roofs stretched open to let shards  Of warm morning day in.   Last night I saw the stadium dancing  Chairs clapping  Hotdogs waving  Balls back flipping prancing around   Last night I saw the mall celebrate  Little toy queen guards marched up and down  The mall celebrating because the day was over   We need to get the washing done  So start to run  Our guests will be coming  They’re going to be sat here grunting  Bring your mates  Tell them to bring crates  We need to get the washing done  We’ve still got a ton  We’re at the party  I’m doing karati  But we need to get the washing done   The thing about a secret is that…   Christmas is…  A lovely feeling.  The world is white like the  north pole and south pole.  It tastes like frozen ice.  It feels like a family adventure.  It smells like chestnuts.   Christmas is  for happy living.  The world is white  like a snow flake.  It tastes like  grandmother’s chocolate.  It feels like  a fuzzy pyjama.  It smells like  a fireplace.  Christmas is in town.   It’s furry  It’s sweet  It’s cute  It eats carrots and grass  It’s white  It’s graceful  It’s adored by almost every girl  It’s the best and most sweetest animal I can think of   Mysteries, lies,  whispers and rumours.  These are the bad.   Most creativeness, washed away  by the unrelenting cruelness of reality.  Re-sparked by good schools  and encouraging people.  That is what life seems to revolve around.   The gentle breeze makes the flags fly from above  and the sunrise sky that I love  Plants will wake up  and grow up with glee  as also will the dancing tree  Quiet cars go along the road  and in the pond, frogs croak to toads  This is a beautiful day that I would bet  That this is the day I shall never forget   There was a guy  Following me all around  I didn’t even know him  But still he followed my every step and sound   the Palace Pier  is awfully near  the booster has a bright light  that can sometimes give old people quite a fright  on the pier there’s a legendary log flume  when it hits the water it gives off a loud BOOM!!!  the roller coaster goes by the name of Turbo  it goes round a loop-the-loop just like so!  the best food on the pier is a burger in a bun  my dad always buys one for his favourite son!   Hole is a house of a mole or mouse  And our home is a hut or house  A burrow is a house for a rabbit  And storing carrots in its burrow is its habit  A house is a shelter for all living things  Nests for birds and castles for kings  A strong house is built with bricks  While a weak house with straws or sticks  We need a house to live in  And shelter is what they give  In protection from the sun, the cold and the rain  A proper house should have a proper drain  And it should have a roof and windowpanes  Fresh air coming through it will relieve us from pain  And a door, of course  A roof should be above  But what the house needs most of all  Is love   You need fingers to reach the plugs  Not the tree’s own  For if he did that he would smash things  Including the glass gnomes!   There’s a zombie under my bed  He’s definitely not dead  His shadow is black  I’m just looking at my back   The beach is hot,  The beach is sandy,  The beach is wet and warm  The beach is getting cold  Everybody is leaving   Once there were four bullies who kept bullying me  Their group was named Math as you can see  There were two boy named Division and Addition  And two girls named Multiplication and Subtraction  They were the horrors which kept running in my mind  They could have been a little kind  Then Abacus came to my rescue  With academy called SIP  With Abacus in hand, concentration in mind,  accuracy in thought and speed on fingers,  I now bully this group called Maths  The Number Kingdom was organised by Abacus  SIP created an interesting numeric trend  And it is also my best friend.   I feel lazy,  we pick a daisy.  My mum said,  “Go and be lazy, LAZY!”   Poem day is a fun day.  Poem day is a Sunday.  Poem day is a Monday.  Poem day  Yay.   We’re on a plane,  We’re on a train,  We’re eating food,  We’re having a snooze,  We’re on the rails,  Upon the trails,  We are so high,  Up in the sky, but all that travelling,  Has made me ravenous!   I scream  you scream  whenever we eat ice cream  I ate too much I got a brain freeze  it’s like I ate some frozen peas  chocolate strawberry vanilla too  if you eat too much you might need the LOO  it’s so yummy  it fills up my tummy  be nice and I will give  and by the way what so you eat it with   I don’t have many pets  Just a cat or two  I really would really like some more  For I have got a few  I have only 3 dinosaurs in the attic  And only just 7 dogs  I may be having 4 or 5 monkeys  Living in the logs  I have just 15 sheep  And only ONE lamb  And a lion, which tends to eat me  Unless I give it ham  I only have 2 parrots  Who LOVE to screech and talk  I only have 5 zebras  Which love to take a walk  I only have ONE elephant  And it is as white as snow  But when I ask my parents for a few more pets  They always say NO   The five-nines bellowing at the mob of soldiers  trudging away from the horrors of shells.   Sometimes I am Tommy Stout  Just pulling the cat out  And sometimes I am Aunt Polly  Putting the kettle on the stout  Sometimes I am Jack  Rolling down the hill  And sometimes I  Pretend to be little Jill  Sometimes I am Johnny  Saying yes or no  Sometimes I am one of the three kittens  And to the park I go  Sometimes I am twinkling in the sky  Being the little star  Leaving the people wondering  What we really are  Sometime I am one of the monkeys  Which are jumping on the bed  Sometimes I am Humpty  Falling off the wall, and bumping my head  Sometimes I am Santa Claus  Jingling my bell  Sometimes I am Miss Polly  Playing with my doll  Sometimes I am in the garden  With my little bouncing ball  Sometimes I am Johnny Thin  Putting the pussy, in the well  Sometimes I am Mary  With a lamb, following around  Sometimes I am teddy  Just touching the ground  Sometimes I am someone  Selling a hot cross bun  Sometimes I am one of three pigs  Just having some fun  Sometimes I am Johnny’s sister  Politely asking the rain to go away  Sometimes I am the rocking horse  Crying Neigh! Neigh!  Sometime I am Miss Muffet  Eating my porridge with my tea  But the very funny and strange thing is  I am never me!!!   Whenever I feel sad  Dominos makes my day  Such tasty pizzas  Being served in a tray  There is cheese pizza with no toppings  Or a chicken sliced pizza, as tasty as can be  I absolutely LOVE pizza  As you can probably see  Then after a pizza, I love a snack  Like a garlic bread or two  YUM YUM YUMMY!!!  It’s too good to be true  And I LOVE the idea of mixing chocolate and pizza  And I never mind a few  And I am sure  You wouldn’t mind one or two  Would you???   Once there was a snail  Who delivered some mail,  He had loads of books  About professional cooks.   The night is…   Kenny the cat is a big rat.  Kenny the cat likes eating pigs.  Kenny the cat peels oranges.  Now he has a friend called Joseph the dog.  He likes eating houses,trees and… a COUNTRY!!!!!!!!!  Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagggggggggggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  But now…  Kenny the cat likes eating that too!  They’re going to eat EVERYONE!!!!!!!!!!!!   Cheer and joy spreed through villages, towns and cities  Happy people gather and sing carols  Reindeer in the north pole get ready to guide Santa’s sleigh  In churches they light the four candles, one every Sunday  Stockings are hung by the fire ready for Santa to fill them  Trees are decorated  Merry people write out Christmas cards and send them to family and friends  Angels sit on the tops of the Christmas trees  Santa flies round the world giving out presents   Christmas can be fun,  Brush outside of your front door,  Have a lovely day   Twas the night before Christmas and all through the house,  Not a creature was stirring not even a mouse.   Cuddles are short festivals of love  Maybe you could even give one to a dove  Love is having a cuddle when you feel sad or when you feel bad.  After a cuddle I feel much better  And if you get a kiss, it makes you feel a bit wetter!   Tick tock I look at the clock  Oh no it’s time to go to school  Tick tock I look at the clock  Yes it’s time to go out for break  Tick tock I look at the clock  Super it’s lunch in ten minutes  Tick tock I look at the clock  Brill it’s the art lesson  Tick tock I look at the clock  At last it’s home time!   Now what should I say to Mrs Stone:  sorry Mrs Stone, I left my pen at home  or  my dog Mutly got very hungry  or  it ss all of the fault of my monkey  or  should I be brave and say it was me?  Naaa…  I’ll say it was my monkey  %~#$£&amp;*!  No wrong choice.   Being a YouTuber is ever so hard.  You’re trying to make a card.  Yes I’m a YouTuber, my channel you seek.

The bark cracks beneath my squeaky bike,  The church bells chime  …10,11,12  The souls of dead people arise from their grave,  They reach for me  For my life  I scream  But nothing comes out  They’ve taken me  My soul  I rise up  Up to heaven  Was this meant to happen?  What did I do to deserve this?  Arghhhhhh  I was alarmed by a scream  Wait, a scream  The scream  It was my scream  It was all a dream   Sailed  Across the world  India was his goal  Landing in the Bahamas   Cheetah  Speedy, spotty  Sprinting, racing, chasing  A ray of the golden sun  Desert   Cows called Daisy  Are often lazy  But cows called Brian  Are always flying  Up in the air  And out into space  Because of the grass  And the gas it makes   Aliens and underpants are the worst mix  Aliens invite themselves around to steal your underpants  when your not watching  They like mum’s pink frilly knickers  and gran’s spotty bloomers,  but when mum comes out to get the washing  they rush back home  So when you go to your drawer  just check there is no aliens still there   Scary as halloween costumes  Underneath the stars  No on will go to the sun   Friends are loyal. Bullies are lame.  Put them together. They’ll both be insane.  But when you need a friend just yelp or cry.  I need a friend to stay by.  Say goodbye to bullies. Say hi to friends.  Hi friends I know you’ll recommend.  But either way bullies are mean.  So friends are loved bullies are hated.  And usual friends have messed  and not been rated.  Some friends are stupid. Some are silly.  And some just get annoying.  But I am a great friend to one and all.  But the thing I can’t do at all  is defend myself against the bullies.  I cry until a friend passes by.  And then I laugh and cry  and my friends don’t judge.  So hey, don’t judge me for how I look!   Once upon a time  a king ruled with a dime  LITERALLY!  HE would flip a coin of heads or tail  to see if a criminal was allowed to bail  If not they’d be thrown in prison  surrounded by mounts of crimson…  rubies!  This king was rich  a very big snitch  He’d cheat in races  and tie the contestants shoe laces  He played chess with 6 year olds  to show that he was cool, Ya know?  He would wear sunglasses inside  and a cap in the snow  sandals in winter  and bracelets that glowed   I do like to spend money  but not too much  I like to keep money too  Now I am spending £1  now £2  then £3  now more  All I see is  ££££££££££££££££££  I can’t stop buying  What’s next?  £90000000000000000000  Can someone please stop me  spending money?   POW CRASH BANG  That’s what I hear all day  My brother is addicted to video games  I should call the police of video games  and POW he’s under arrest  No more games for you, boy  You can scream, you can shout  you can squeal  but no video games for you in your cell!   Science, SCIENCE, SCIENCE  Science, Science, SCIENCE  It’s so confusing  Alive animals  How can they be reducing?  I mean I see so many dogs  Just running along the street  And cute little kittens  Searching for a treat  Global warming  Earth is getting hot  Why, it’s winter  How can there be ANY droughts  Sun will die after some time  But, from what I can see  It’s shining brightly  And merrily as it could be  Everybody says  Earth pulls things towards it  Then how do astronauts get into space  (That statement might be true, I must admit)  Sedimentation, decantation, is used for filtering water  There is so much water in the sea  Then why should we save water??  If we can filter it, from the sea??  Science, Science, SCIENCE  It’s as confusing as can be   The waves of sand rolled over the shore,  Scuttle went the crab with the really sharp claw,  I love to play on the beach all day,  Sand makes me whoop with glee,  Joyful days for me, me, me,  Snaky sea runs across the beach,  The seagulls wave with a threatening screech,  My day was great, please can I go again  I’ll write this down in my diary with pen.   My daddy told me to join the navy  “Because the waves are very wavy”  So I started on the 8th of May  The others made fun of me everyday  You have thin legs, tiny boy  And they will laugh with plenty o’ joy  One day the ship began tumbling  I hid under the table trembling  One knock on the head knocked me out  And there I heard my father shout  I realised it was all a dream  And there I sighed in relief and peace   I wonder what my grandchildren will be like  I’m sure they’ll be great  I am sure they’ll eat their vegetables  Which are kept on their plate  My grandchildren will be obedient  They’ll study a ton  They won’t eat junk food  Like cookies or a bun  There will be two children  A girl and a boy  They would rather study  Instead of playing with a toy  They’ll not be old fashioned  And the new brand  Whatever they are like  I am sure they’ll be grand   I went down the hill  and died  Ate a chicken, fried  I went and had a pill
