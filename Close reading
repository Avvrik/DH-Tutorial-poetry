### Детские стихотворения

#### Wonder
      When the snow turns into water
      Spring will emerge from its slumber.
      And the birds will sing,
      and the sun will rise.
      The world is full of wonder.
#### Day and Night
      In the day you'll wave goodbye run around and fly a kite.
      But when the day comes to an end sleep is what you must attend.
      Climb in your bed and fluff your pillow take one last look out the window.
      Ask yourself one more question...

      Why does the sun go up and down shine and darken every town?
      Let's not worry about that right now but I know you'll find out.
      Night to dawn to light to dusk yep that's right nothing wrong.
#### A Ballad:
#### The Wild
      The wild,
      It’s new in style,
      To get to the wild 
      Takes quite a while.

      Out there,
      There’s bears,
      And hares.
      And the wind will mess up your hair.

      And I hope you will take time to find the wild,
      Trust me, It will be worth your while.
#### Leaves
      It starts as a seed planted in the yard,
      But soon is a sapling with one tiny leaf.
      As the tree grows, lots more leaves appear.
      It gets higher and higher and touches the sky!
      Then, one day I wake to a world of leaves twisting and twirling up high.
      It's fall! It's fall!
      I pull on my coat and jump into my boots.
      I'm ready to go out and play.
      I run out the door and am instantly covered with leaves.
      This is the best day ever!
#### Love and Hate
      Love is everything that hate is not.
      Love is nourishment while hate is starvation.
      Love is hope. Hate is fear.
      Hate works against you, while love works with you.
      Love is beautiful as shining marble palaces and fairy wings,
      glitter and shine and soft, sweet rose petals.
      Hate is darker than midnight, with no glimmer of stars to represent hope.
      Dull gray, sharp black, and dark, dark red, with fury of Hell.
      Love and hate go side by side,
      for without one, the other does not exist.
      But I will choose love,
      and take up the cause,
      for Love is hope.
 
 ### Наивная поэзия
 
 #### Hand me another drink
      Soupy slurred words slide from her lips and drip to the floor,
      Mixing in with the pool of regurgitated gin and tonic.
      Her mouth is bitter but her thoughts are true;
      Only the drunk can tell the truth.
      Her incoherent words fall to the floor followed closely by her slouched figure and salty tears.
      She sleeps on the bathroom floor,
      Soaked in the mess she's created.
 #### The Dancer
      With skin of satin and heart of glass 
      The dancer watches the seasons pass
      The crisp winter air has gone away
      Leaving summer an empty stage

      Her hair is long 
      Her body tired
      For she has long awaited summers hour

      The day is light, life leaps through the sky
      Bringing forth flowers and bright butterflies

      The nights are warm 
      A speckled sky
      The orchestra plays, natures guide

      She stands to dance
      Her eyes are blue
      But alas she has lost her dancing shoes 

      The moonlight dances in her eyes
      Reflecting the light as she cries
#### an artist of words
      emotions bounce around
      to eventually be transcribed 
      into beautiful words

      a patchwork of thoughts from her mind, 
      made with fragmented sentences, 
      allow her to expose part of her soul.

      words that coax
      images 
      or emotions
      or memories
      to arise
      in other's minds.

      the most magnificent artwork
      that changes for every reader
#### Untitled
      The night sky we see
      is not the same,
      as the one our ancestors looked upon.

      Stars have faded,
      urban sprawl has invaded,
      and the once perfect span of night
      may be lost in our sea of light.

      The busy people do not notice.
      No one looks to the stars anymore

      The thick black sky,
      speckled with whispers of distant life.
      Beautiful lanterns floating in the dark.
      Guardians of our universe, 
      watch life dance with death,
      as  they silently fade away.

      There are no more answers from the gods.
      No more stories in the night.
      No more questioning how everybody came to have life.

      The world is too busy,
      drenched in it's artificial light.
      Too busy to get lost in this magnificent expanse.
      Too busy to look to our creators.
      The sparks that create life.

#### Proof of Immortality
      FOR there is one thing braver than all flowers;	
          Richer than clear gems; wider than the sky;	
      Immortal and unchangeable; whose powers	
          Transcend reason, love and sanity!	

      And thou, beloved, art that godly thing!	        
          Marvelous and terrible! in glance	
      An injured Juno roused against Heaven’s King!	
          And thy name, lovely One, is Ignorance.	
          (William Carlos Williams)
#### Sea Fever
      I must go down to the seas again, to the lonely sea and the sky,
      And all I ask is a tall ship and a star to steer her by;
      And the wheel’s kick and the wind’s song and the white sail’s shaking,
      And a grey mist on the sea’s face, and a grey dawn breaking.

      I must go down to the seas again, for the call of the running tide
      Is a wild call and a clear call that may not be denied; 
      And all I ask is a windy day with the white clouds flying,
      And the flung spray and the blown spume, and the sea-gulls crying.

      I must go down to the seas again, to the vagrant gypsy life,
      To the gull’s way and the whale’s way where the wind’s like a whetted knife;
      And all I ask is a merry yarn from a laughing fellow-rover,
      And quiet sleep and a sweet dream when the long trick’s over.
      (John Masefield)
#### Lightenings viii
      The annals say: when the monks of Clonmacnoise
      Were all at prayers inside the oratory
      A ship appeared above them in the air.

      The anchor dragged along behind so deep
      It hooked itself into the altar rails
      And then, as the big hull rocked to a standstill,

      A crewman shinned and grappled down the rope
      And struggled to release it. But in vain.
      ‘This man can’t bear our life here and will drown,’

      The abbot said, ‘unless we help him.’ So
      They did, the freed ship sailed, and the man climbed back
      Out of the marvellous as he had known it.
      (Seamus Heaney)
